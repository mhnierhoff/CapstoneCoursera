It is also hard to exercise coercive authority over our secular leaders -- the president during his term in office or life-tenured Supreme Court justices.

Benjamin has been a big-play threat for the Hurricanes over the years. Initially an electric return specialist only, he eventually became an effective pass-catching option.

He will be somewhat limited in his transition to the NFL due to his size, but there are many receivers of his stature that have shown the ability to overcome this at the next level. Benjamin has third- to fourth-round value due to his speed, ability to separate and experience as a returner.

Another theory is that the Reds worked Chapman as a starter in spring training, and that gave him a chance to develop his slider and split-fingered fastball.

IAN GAVAN/GETTY IMAGESVera Farmiga may not have captured the top prize at the BAFTAs, but her red carpet look swept away the competition.DANIEL DEME/EPAAnne-Marie DuffThere's nothing up in the air about Vera Farmiga's winning look at the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) awards Sunday night. She looked divine in a dramatic but not over-the-top Marchesa gown. Also topping the list of best dressed were Anne-Marie Duff, the pregnant wife of James McAvoy, in a ruby gown that skimmed beautifully over her belly; Rebecca Hall, in a sophisticated throwback to '40s fashion; and Gabourey Sidibe, who made it work in a champagne gown with a flattering V neckline.
In a month, the pile compacted a few more inches. With a final list of hardy, native, water-stingy plants in a color palette shot through with rich burgundy, copper and gold -- namely lavender, Mexican orange blossom, 'Silver Anniversary' abelia, 'Bronze Veil' hair grass 'Cheyenne Sky' switch grass and 'Karley Rose' fountain grass plus assorted euphorbias -- I set off to visit friends near Seattle. On the way, I stopped by Tsugawa Nursery in Woodland, Wash., home of an extensive selection of Japanese maples, to pick out native shrubs and ground covers, along with the sapling for my mom. When my tortoiseshell kitty died suddenly, I dug the tree hole atop the berm one rainy evening, sprinkled the ashes and dedicated the 'Autumn Moon' maple to both of them.

Working memory is the process that allows us to temporarily store and manipulate information that is critical for higher mental processes such as abstract thinking and problem solving.
Matching grants make combating fraud and abuse a low-return proposition for states. Providers inevitably chafe under the additional paperwork and investigations necessary to police fraud. Currently, if a state inflicts enough of this political pain to eliminate $1 of fraud, it only keeps 20 to 50 cents; the rest goes back to Washington. As a result, Mr. O'Malley and other governors have quite rationally made policing fraud and abuse too low a priority.

John Harbison and Vijay Iyer both confronted titans of the Classical era in Haydn and Mozart respectively. Harbison offered both a comment on and completion to the initial two movements of Haydn's Op. 103; his buoyant finale echoed the balance and tensions of the original. Iyer took a different tack in his comment on Mozart's fragmentary E Minor quartet: acknowledging in his program note the inherent absurdity of being tasked to complete a Mozart work, he dwelled on a final phrase, repeated it obsessively, tore it apart, took it wandering and brought it back tattered but recognizable. Knowing what we do of Mozart's sense of humor, he'd likely have appreciated Iyer's work, and at the very least gotten a good laugh from it.

"Catherine the Great" by Robert Massie (574 pages, Random House, $35) is a logical successor to Massie's biography of Peter the Great, as the author seems to be working his way through the Romanov rulers of Russia, not all of whom were so great. In Catherine's case, the transformation of a nervous, relatively poor German girl into a confident, imperious empress was the marvel of the 18th century.

Ace the same test on your second try and you can buy your certification. Lesson for consumers: Your personal trainer might not be as qualified as his framed certification suggests.

Some churchmen take exception to some of President Barack Obama's positions on matters of faith. I suggest these men of faith take a closer look at the true meaning of religion. All three Abrahamic religions — Christianity, Judaism and Islam — have as their central theme the commandments to protect the widow and orphan, to clothe the naked, feed the hungry and shelter the homeless. That is termed social justice. All this talk about contraception, in my mind, is just superficial chatter totally missing the central message of religion.

While in high school, Frank did hand-lettering and cartoons for a sign company. He went to Michigan State in East Lansing, intending to become a commercial artist, but he spotted an ad in the student newspaper. The State News needed someone to do a daily cartoon and was willing to pay $5 apiece. This being 1961, $5 for a cartoon was good money, and Frank jumped. Frankly Speaking, a single-panel cartoon, focused on student life and soon became such a big hit that 350 other campus papers started running it. It also created such an impressive portfolio that Frank was hired right out of college to be an artist and writer for Hallmark cards. During his four years in Kansas City, Mo., he worked with other professional cartoonists from around the country and learned enough about freelancing and syndication to launch his own career as a newspaper cartoonist.

This seems to be Boyd's point, however, as evidenced by the fact that Rief is last seen wandering forlornly into a thick London fog. Waiting for Sunrise might have the feel and pace of a thriller, but its ultimate focus is on the psychic damage inflicted on some of those who enter the permanent night of espionage.

The format feels familiar at first, because we've seen countless bands profiled through their rise, fall and struggles to remain relevant on the old VH1 show "Behind the Music." But Anderson and Metzler break through that show's often-shallow approach, with the band offering incredible access to its creative process and, perhaps more surprisingly, its members problems, both personal and professional. It's a refreshing approach; the warts-and-more-warts style somehow makes the film ultimately more uplifting.

Her take was similar to many readers: not completely sympathetic to Osmar, since he seemed to be plenty willing to be arrested — but convinced the arrest was foolish nonetheless.

Her first bit of luck was to inherit good genes. Longevity runs in her family, at least among the women: Hempel's mother lived to be 90, one sister 98, and the other is still going at 96. Her brothers died in their 50s and 60s, but Hempel attributes this to poor nutrition, noting one brother's consumption of too much red meat and disapprovingly recounting the time the other skipped breakfast and then ordered pancakes for lunch.
After the game, Thibodeau was asked what Boozer could do to help the Bulls extend this waste of time. The coach listed stuff such as passing, playmaking, rebounding, posting up, hitting from the outside, blah, blah and blah, because the coach could've said that about any of his players.

In the original, a little boy gives a gruff football player Joe Greene a Coke as he comes off the field. The Downy remake stars Greene and actress Amy Sedaris (in the little boy role) giving Greene a can of Downy fabric softener.

The first inhabitants, the Ciboneys, arrived during what is considered the Pre-Ceramic Culture. Arawaks came around A.D. 100, followed by Caribs and Tainos. Christopher Columbus claimed the islands for Spain in the late 1500s; the battle between the Indians and Columbus is considered the first insurgence in the New World.
Seventeen states and the U.S. military have effectively banned payday loans, which attract low-income borrowers who need a cash advance on paychecks. Georgia has declared payday lending to be felony racketeering. But in California, payday storefronts outnumber Starbucks coffeehouses.

"Tuesday nights I'm on the track with Phidippides, Wednesday I'm running with the Runner's Roost club, the weekends I have long runs or races. I love to race. I probably race too much."

At SeaWorld Orlando, the finger part works OK, but the ticket-scanning process falters. Sometimes I'm told that my annual pass is too faded and that I should have it replaced at guest services. But have you seen the sun-drenched and winding guest-services line at SeaWorld? At that point, I'm in no mood to queue up for anything other than the Manta roller coaster.
And they were in the words of Father Thomas Gilles, the recently retired pastor of St. Mary who delivered the sermon at Demetrius' funeral.
Laughter is common when Schlau talks about her girls. And she does so often. She meets with police recruits to talk about responsible driving, a large screen flashing an image of her daughters behind her. Mitchell was driving 126 mph while talking to his girlfriend on a cellphone and emailing another officer for directions to a car crash.
It's not clear whether he will compete immediately for a starting job or whether coaches will prefer to have him develop this year.

The Star found about 200 doctors who have practiced in Kansas or Missouri since 1990 and have had five or more malpractice case payments made on their behalf, without ever being disciplined by the state's board. The number of malpractice claims against the doctors is unclear because individual cases may involve payments from more than one source.
Louie has requested the state require Glassboro Schools to cease and desist compensating Simmons the monthly $3,000 stipend for her services, and require Simmons to reimburse all monies paid to her consulting firm, which could total more than $127,000, over the duration of her employment with the district.
For Ryan Taylor, Cuvée Blanc is an outgrowth of his evolution as a winemaker. As he assumed more winemaking responsibilities at Mt. Vernon, he also consulted for other wineries in the Sierra foothills. In that role he's overseen the development of popular blended wines based on Rhône Valley grape varieties.
Stokes is not qualified. A decade of experience tells us that. An august panel of lawyers tells us that. In a perfect world, she would not be re-elected Nov. 8.
A woman, driving a Lexus, got $30 of gas on the Black Horse Pike on April 9 and tried to pay with a pre-paid card, but the card only had $1.72 on it. She refused to pay for the rest and left.
Many of Tribune's stations, including WGN-TV Chicago and WPHL-TV Philadelphia, have rights to local teams, and sports fans can be very vocal when denied their home team's games.
He ignored the security guards and walked out into the Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza, not sure what he would see or how he would feel when he saw it. He stood in front of the statue for a few minutes, then walked around the reflecting pool and along the long concrete wall. He thought about the selfless way his friend gave up his football career for his country, and the frustrating way his life ended.
Al-Hashemi meanwhile says that bodyguards were tortured to extract confessions, and two died under torture—accusations that the government denies.
Right now, he said, you're looking at masterpieces. I characterize that presentation as a series of islands. I don't want the public to think African art is static. We need to project dynamism.

Stay home. Stay and care of the garden. Enjoy the blueberry bushes and the apricot trees, and mow the lawn. Keep it nice. Try to deflect, as much as possible, their 4-year-old daughter's questions about going to Disneyland.
For viewers who drifted away from "Desperate Housewives," the final season has offered good reason to tune in. The writing is sharper than it's been for several years, with plenty of reminders about why viewers made the show a habit when it debuted.
The Pakistanis will likely dig in their heels. Cooperation, dreadful as it has been since the Osama bin Laden raid, is likely to get worse.
In his opening statement, Dean Hoag, who is on loan from the U.S. attorney's office, told the jury that Winfrey was in desperate financial straits in the spring of 2004. He needed money, Hoag said. He got a gun in late May and said something like he would do what he had to do, Hoag said.
Imagine how good he'd look in red, returning to the scene of Monday's triumph.
"Middle linebacker is equivalent to the quarterback on the offense," Stuckey said. "You have to be the like defensive coordinator. You have to know the defense as well as he does, because you have to tell guys what to do if they don't know what to do."
Senate Democrats say four other states have considered similar legislation, with New Jersey the first to sign one into law. A snapshot review by the National Employment Law Project found more than 150 jobs with discriminatory language. It issued a report in July 2011.
Ohio's string of double-digit unemployment rates began in April, when 10.2 percent were out of work. The last time the state surpassed 10 percent unemployment, in October 1981, the rate stayed in double digits for 28 straight months until January 1984. It peaked at 13.8 percent in December 1982 and January 1983.
"If I was able to buy, I'd definitely buy because this is the time to do it," said Mark Wells, 42, of West Chester, Ohio, who lost his job at FedEx Corp.'s freight division in February and has been looking for a job ever since. His wife makes $8 an hour working at a day care.
Some observers regard Mahsud as the most potent threat to emerge in years from the tribal milieu, a leader who has shown himself capable of unifying an array of disparate homegrown groups, even while exchanging crucial logistical aid, know-how and resources with Al Qaeda. If his coalition holds firm, these observers say, he could be in a position to threaten not only Musharraf but the Pakistani state.
Dayton and his staff also have met with Rep. Tom Hackbarth, R-Cedar, who is preparing legislation that would authorize racinos -- slots at the state's two horse racing tracks. Hackbarth, who plans to meet with Dayton again this week, said the governor is "very, very interested'' in his proposal, which like the casino plan would likely face formidable opposition.
Many major diseases, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, digestive disorders, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's and cancer, have recently been tied to a lack of sleep or a disrupted sleep schedule.

If it is just about awkwardness, then time will kill the novelty pretty soon.
But environmental activist Larry Gibson, who has long battled Massey and the practice of mountaintop removal coal mining, said there was one thing Blankenship did best -- to his own disadvantage: "He was very successful in bringing the worst publicity to the industry."
Ken Silva, the company's chief technology officer, said Thursday that the latest changes are needed to keep up with ballooning Internet traffic and with spikes in usage caused by major news events and computer attacks.
Signing the nation's toughest immigration legislation into law has thrust Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer into the national spotlight, and recent polls suggest the move has given her job-performance ratings a boost.

The 2012 Maryland Foosball Championships will be held Feb. 17-19 at the Holiday Inn Columbia in Jessup, with 150 enthusiasts of the table soccer game competing for $12,000 in prize money.
"March and April tend to be the high points for the year when it comes to foreclosure filings, but this year, those numbers were quite low compared to recent years," said Ryan McMaken, a spokesman for the Colorado Division of Housing. "On top of that, every metro area in the state showed a declining trend in foreclosure auction sales, and this suggests that foreclosure prevention efforts in general are continuing to have an effect statewide."
It's also unclear how much time the defense's best player will see. Star linebacker Vontaze Burfict was benched in the team's Nov. 25 loss to Cal for a personal foul and later reportedly refused to go back in the game, but Erickson said he'll at least travel to Las Vegas.
"Some people just can't continue to work beyond age 62 for either health reasons or they're just not able to find jobs," said David Certner, legislative policy director for AARP. "Just because we tell people they should work longer doesn't mean that there are employers out there willing to hire people."
Global volatility and uncertainty, along with rapidly evolving technology, make predictions difficult.
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Defiantly waving an Arizona state flag, the self-described American patriot leaps into an octagon-shaped ring amid blaring music and loud boos from an overwhelmingly Latino audience, who hold aloft signs in Spanish supporting his masked Mexican opponents.
"We're the scruffy guys, right?" he said. "We're the guys that have got sort of this mutt DNA because of the fact that we ended up being here and a lot of people thought that we shouldn't be here, right? I mean we were sort of usurping somebody else's right to live.
Brian and Monica Laplander, a married couple in their early 40s, spotted the growth in non-sport riding and in 2009 and started making bike bags called panniers, which attach directly to the bike and can hold plenty of cargo. Their fledgling company is called Carsick Designs (www.carsickdesigns.com). Brian Laplander's full-time job offers a touch of irony: he does collision repair at a Roseville auto body shop.
Hey, Joe: There are days when I really don't know. In the interest of full disclosure I will say that my full name is James Paul Hoynes. I just want to stay on the good side of the Dominican National Police.
Hey, Tony: As a long-time fan, it's painful to watch this year's version of the Browns. So, tell me if this is the reality of the situation to ease my mind: The focus this year is NOT on winning but on evaluating the current roster to establish a draft and F/A wish list at the end of the season, and for the coaches to settle in to their roles. As much as the fans want to win now, the Holmgren/Heckert regime will need a couple of years to undo the debacle of the past decade in order to form a team of solid players to fit the new offensive and defensive schemes. If this is the case, I can accept the poor performances and won't feel like I'm wasting my Sunday afternoons in a sports bar. -- Ken Knapp, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
Another noteworthy feature of the old gym was a big banner hanging at one end, listing the previous tournament champions. The roster had many familiar names of schools around St. Louis, but what stood out was "Crystal City" listed three consecutive times in the late 1950s and early '60s. That was when future NBA star and presidential candidate Bill Bradley was playing high-school ball, on his way to becoming the best college basketball player in America.

Despite the problems, Dance has helped lead the school system to record high graduation rates, record low dropout rates and improved test scores, said Terry Grier, the school system's superintendent.
2010 Suacci Carciere Sonoma County Rosé ($18, 13.7%): Time to bury all those jokes about Pinot Noir tasting like Syrah. Here's a rosé blended from both, mostly Syrah from Dry Creek mixed with bled-off Pinot juice from this notable Sebastopol vineyard. Savory and foresty, with fresh mint and strawberry, and a burnt-orange tone.
Forward Jorge Perlaza, whose penetrating runs gave the Crew fits, earned a free kick just outside the box in the 23 minute. Cooper had a good run – and a vicious shot – but didn’t come close.
In April, not long after taking the reins of GM from its ousted former leader, CEO Fritz Henderson was asked about the possibility and said it was "not something that's high on my list of things to do."
"It's concerning that this governor thinks fiscal responsibility equates to tax cuts for the wealthy and lost property tax relief for the most everyone else," Hester said.
"I think its time to look forward to the real future, the future without (Brandon) Roy and Oden. At best Roy has three more good years, but will steadily decline in every aspect after that. Oden, to me, is toast. I wanted to believe he would come back and work his way to becoming a beast this year, but I just don't see how that's possible anymore. Face it, people are not meant to be taller than 6'9" at most and even that I think is pushing it. Honestly I think the days of a Shaq are over, Dwight Howard is the only exception."
I think it's a very important pipeline. The output of the oil sands is now equivalent to the Libyan exports before the civil war. It's a big number. It could double by the next decade. It's next door to us. It doesn't have to come here by tankers. It's part of a larger trading relationship. And I think it really contributes to energy security.
"When you get bogged down this time of year, when there's only so much time left, trying to implement your system or your process - now is not the right time," Snead said. "Because there's so much to the change, the language, data bases, how you do things, how information's spit out."
"This is about jobs in the local economy," Garrou said. "Once they're gone they're gone. That's what it boiled down to."
It's that coal-fired brick oven, which reaches superheated temperatures of 1,200 degrees. It not only cooks the thin-crust pizzas fast, it also gives them a unique blistered edge and smoky scent. No other pizza in town tastes quite like it.
The roommate woke up during the assault and reported it to university police.
It's smart to be cautious about changing plans, particularly given your medical history. But according to Michael Grodsky, an insurance expert for the nonprofit Cancer Support Community — Benjamin Center based in Los Angeles, there's no downside to applying for a new health plan to see what's available. Just don't cancel the coverage you have until you've secured a new plan.
"I only did these things because I believed I had the approval of the New Jersey Medical Board," Brigham said.
De Smet got a championship effort out of C.J. Durham, who won the 110 hurdles. Tommy Brown won the high jump with a leap of six feet. Austin Del Rosso slipped past SLUH's Matthew Nicholson and Ruebbelke to win the 3,200.
Still, others weren't so impressed.
48) The Jacksons' (yes, those Jacksons) Victory Tour launched right here in Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium in 1984. It was the last concert tour featuring all of the Jackson brothers together, including Michael. Tickets were $30 each, an unheard-of sum at the time. Fans went crazy for the moonwalk, songs from Thriller and the other brothers, too, presumably.
Most of these new stations offer little if anything that's local (other than the commercials). TheCoolTV, however, is tailored to each city where it's carried. Each affiliate has its own playlist that reflects TheCoolTV's research into the community's musical tastes, favorite genres and hometown bands.
His plea was the latest in the largest corruption investigation in Cuyahoga County history, one that has netted convictions against dozens of public officials and contractors. In December, Russo will be sentenced to nearly 22 years in prison on 21 public corruption charges.

"It's obvious that there are so many things they've just ignored," he said. "But you can't treat death and injury like a line item in a budget."
"We have accomplished our core objectives during a very difficult political and economic climate, defending the integrity of our contract against an Administration hell-bent on undermining this legal right at every opportunity," the union negotiators wrote. "Given this fact, we support this tentative agreement and recommend its ratification."
One fund would consist of assets turned over by the Atkinsons as part of the settlement. A smaller fund would include any money US Fidelis has on hand after liquidation.

While users scrambled on Thursday to stock up on synthetic drugs that became illegal at midnight, a state judge refused to stop Minnesota's new drug ban from going into effect.
Wendell Maxey: Much like the Blazers themselves, the line with Greg is continuously, "wait until next year." Come to think of it that really depends if the big fella is in Portland next season. Imagine Oden getting a second start elsewhere in the league, actually staying healthy for a season, and putting up a double-double anchoring the middle. Scary thought. It's almost as frightening as Portland bringing him back and watching Oden endure yet more rehab, or worse yet, sustain another injury. Keeping Greg Oden: that's a tough decision for any GM to make, let alone for a team without a permanent GM.
"The market had already voted that we were at the low end of investment grade," Shanks said.
Obama, gay marriage and a win for bigotry in North Caroline: Los Angeles Times -- North Carolina, where marriage is strictly between a man, a woman and his pregnant mistress. Cheap John Edwards jokes aside, Tuesday's lopsided 60 percent vote in North Carolina for an amendment banning same-sex marriage is sort of a mixed bag for equal rights proponents.
To make its case, B Street is casting the theater project as an affordable and homegrown affair. In that vein, the company is not above comparing the merits of the project to the city's current quest to get the $391 million downtown arena project built.
Friday was once considered the unluckiest day of the week to get hitched. Folks also said that encountering a cross-eyed person on the way to a wedding meant the marriage was ill-fated. In 19th-century Atlantic City, a justice of the peace reluctantly agreed to marry a couple on a Friday, according to a Cleveland Plain Dealer article. But when the justice got his first look at the man and woman, he canceled the event. "I'm not superstitious," he proclaimed, "but I draw the line at marrying cross-eyed people on a Friday."
John Mohrmann isn't surprised by any of this. Not completely, anyway.
The rating: Fast and loose, bordering on Major Malarkey.
Serge Le Borgne, a Paris gallerist and curator, will serve as director of the institute.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, and described it as signaling disgust and anger at a surprise overnight visit by President Barack Obama, who had departed the country shortly before the first heavy explosion echoed across the city.
2004: Kevin Hart, The Bug's "Waiting for Godot"
Exasperation over the growing public health implications of pollution inspired the call for environmental education and led to the first Earth Day celebration on April 22, 1970. Millions of Americans spanning diverse social, political and economic spectrums joined together, both in service and to protest the effects of oil spills, air pollution, raw sewage, toxic dumps, pesticides and wildlife extinction on American landscapes, waterways and skies. This movement ultimately resulted in the creation of the EPA and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. Legislation soon followed to address the nation's drinking water supply, hazardous waste management and toxic waste cleanups.

The Obamas donated $172,130 to 39 charities; the biggest single donation, $117,130 went to the Fisher House Foundation which helps disabled veterans.
The differences in the older cities to the north and younger cities to the south can be seen in Laguna Niguel and Anaheim. Laguna Niguel has 63,000 residents but only 59 full-time employees, who generally concentrate on providing recreational services and well-paved streets. Virtually everything else is outsourced at a savings.
We can live with wrinkles in our beds, too, thank you, Sandra. But not on our foreheads, thank you, Botox.
This is the first time the agency has collected and released such information about the deported. It is doing so at the behest of a 2010 Congressional order to begin tracking the number of undocumented parents of American children being deported.
What's the link? If you don't regularly brush and floss, tartar builds up on your teeth and irritates your gums. This bacteria-loving tartar turns to plaque, triggering bodywide inflammation. Next, LDL cholesterol-related plaque builds up in your arteries. From there, it's double the chance of heart disease.
She emphasized, however, that her attention now is focused on winning re-election to her House seat in the upcoming Nov. 2 election. She said she'll decide on whether to enter the mayor's race at some point after that.
I walked by the old Döner Kebab restaurant, 515 S.W. Fourth Ave., Tuesday and they were closed, it looked like for good. And it looks like their website is down. Another brick-and-mortar lunch option bites the dust?
As to his contention that the "childfree movement" is disorganized and uncertain about policy, there would be an element of truth to that, if I believed there were a cohesive "childfree movement" to speak of. The childfree aren't monolithic in their beliefs. There are hard left, hard right, moderate and politically apathetic childfree people. In terms of religious beliefs, they're across the board. The one (and only) thing they have in common is never having been, and never wanting to become, a parent. The time may come when childfree PACs form, but it hasn't happened yet. There is no "Million Childfree March" penciled in on my calendar yet, either.
A 2007 law approved by a Democratic Congress gradually lowered the rates but pops them back up to 6.8 percent in July because lawmakers were worried about costs.

Scutari said he hasn’t decided whether to have his Judiciary Committee vet Patterson. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said senators have a constitutional duty to give the governor’s nominee a hearing.
Obama chose Daley to be his White House chief of staff in January 2011, but the former banker and veteran political fighter Daley has had a somewhat rocky tenure.
In one of the most comprehensive health examinations of body piercing, researchers have found that the wildly popular fashion statement is relatively safe although about 20% of piercings become infected.
The 10-month-old boy who was pulled from a Mesa pool Sunday morning has died, police said.
Fred Meyer officials said sustainable touches will be the most visible difference in the store. Solar panels are attached to the store's roof, which also features a skylight that self-adjusts to maximize energy efficiency. Employees will recycle and compost on-site, which Merrill described as a unique practice among the company's 131 stores in the Northwest.
"NorCal is finally getting its due. We are maturing as a regional cuisine, a great one, no less. And it's going to get even better. I think because of this we are not afraid of that hazy label of California Cuisine any more. Folks now have a grasp of what one says when they describe themselves as California."

Rapha's latest invention will be out in six months: a cycling brogue shoe. It's made of leather that has been dimpled like a wingtip but also has a recessed cleat that will attach to pedals—without clicking on the floor when walking.
The rotator cuff is one of the most important components of the shoulder joint. Comprising a group of muscles and tendons that help keep the shoulder joint in place, the rotator cuff muscles and their tendons provide stability and power most of the shoulder joint movement enabling you to lift your arms and reach overhead.
The ring was not $8,900. It was $89,000. The damn thing was nearly seven carats. We were wildly misquoted by the first saleswoman.
A JetBlue spokeswoman attributed the incident, which began more than three hours into the flight, to "a medical situation involving the captain." An off-duty JetBlue pilot who was on board took the captain's spot in the cockpit before the plane landed in Amarillo, where the captain was taken to a medical facility, the spokeswoman said.
How do you spend Saturdays?
Drumsticks are the ideal portable entree. A wet rub of various spices, orange zest and orange juice coats the chicken before grilling. Then, you can either eat the drumsticks dry or mop them with your favorite barbecue sauce (best packed on the side). The drumsticks are good warm or cold, so they can be cooked up to a day or two in advance.
"We do not believe this this kind of attack that you saw in Damascus is representative of the opposition," Carney said. "There are clearly extremist elements in Syria, as we have said all along, who are trying to take advantage of the chaos in that country — chaos brought about by Assad's brutal assault on his own people."
To report a vehicle that is parked on a public street and has not been moved for three or more consecutive days, call the South San Francisco Police Dispatch Center at 650-829-3939. This is a guided recorded line for the reporting of abandoned vehicles in the Cities of Pacifica and South San Francisco.
Then there's another giant market distortion. With Prop. 13 limiting their ability to tap property taxes, local governments since 1978 have sought sales-tax generating businesses. That skews development toward shopping malls, auto malls and "big-box" retail - with their low-paying service jobs - instead of new manufacturing plants and other industry.
Buck answered: "It was almost 20 years to the day and anybody who asks me about it and why I did it, I did it for my mom who was watching and hanging on every word and misses my dad like crazy. It's in St. Louis. St. Louis kid David Freese hits the home run so it just fit. And I'm not going to be a Jack Buck cover band and do his hits. … I'm just going to leave well enough alone and that will be that."
I once thought the Taste without superstar performers would still draw crowds. Even wrote a column saying so. I was wrong.
The district attorney's office says 27-year-old Rianne Celine Theriault-Odom was also charged Wednesday with mayhem and torture. The defendant was set for arraignment in Van Nuys Superior Court.
"Dreamgirls", recently produced by McCluer High School's Comet Theater, tells the story of the genesis, evolution and eventual downfall of the fictional African-American girl group the Dreams. McCluer's ambitious production was pulled off exceptionally well, with notable performances and technical aspects.
Two soups and both were good  an asparagus that, thankfully, tasted like asparagus, and a chowder with mussels that had that smoky goodness but lacked the thick, rustic creamy mouthfeel we might have expected. It was slightly watery but still flavorful.
ø Hockey stick studies still have critics: In his forthcoming book, Energy for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines, Muller criticizes hockey stick data presented in a 1999 World Meteorological Organization report. And at last year's American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, Mann moderated a panel where climate scientist James Annan argued that hockey stick-style temperature reconstructions are likely only reliable going back about 800 years, not as far back as some of Mann's projections. But these are largely disagreements along scientific lines.
We Are Ohio, the coalition of union groups opposed to SB5, has successfully placed a referendum on the Nov. 8 ballot asking voters to repeal the law championed by Kasich, and polling has suggested voters will do just that.

Nopales, the cactus, is unquestionably healthful, a source of vitamin C and potassium and bioflavonoids. Tortillas made with nopales taste basically like tortillas, although when it is time for a second round of tortillas, you may well opt for the regular ones, which are somewhat less puddingy inside.

I am one of the lucky Pacificans who gets polled via phone every time a parcel tax survey is conducted. In my opinion, these surveys have been "contrived" to get the results they want.

With this survey, the people who paid for the poll will ensure themselves that the results show the taxpayers of Pacifica support the parcel tax. An unbiased survey would ask, "Would you support a parcel tax of $48 to help fund JUHSD"? Yes/No.

For a couple of months, Yankees fans got to see what Jesus Montero could do with the bat, and they had to like what they saw. In 69 big league plate appearances, Montero showed he could hit for average (.328 batting average), hit for power (four doubles, four home runs) and get on base (.406 on base percentage). To top it off, in the postseason, Montero went 2 for 2 with an RBI in his only two trips to the plate.

Tax considerations: If you have retirement plans, 59�1/2 marks a key age. That's when you can tap your accounts and avoid the 10 percent penalty on early withdrawals that normally applies. Age 62 is when you can start taking Social Security, but your monthly benefits could be around 30 percent lower than if you wait until full retirement age, which varies by birth year.
Together, the hurricane-haired bard and the grizzled-beyond-its-years bar band reinvented rock, meshing Dylan's poetic assault with roller-coaster surges of sound: Robertson's slice-and-dice guitar, the gospel-soul keyboard interplay of Manuel and Hudson, the peerless groove of Danko's bass and Helm's drums.
"If the schools do not improve, we have no choice but to say we cannot be responsible for sponsoring you," said John Jackson, charter school liaison for the university.

The Santi Pinot Grigio Sortesele 2010 is white-gold, with scents of citrus and stone fruit, as well as vegetal aromas that are funky and intriguing. The wine has crisp citrus flavors, a light mineral overlay and good acidity. It's quite dry and light, and the tart finish balances nicely. The wine is best imbibed as a sipper with food that won't bury it.
Ward said supporters had asked him to consider a run for mayor and he would not rule out the possibility. "I think it's very flattering," Ward said, "but highly unlikely, given the politics of New York City."
Among the model bills Webber received was one that would create a privatization council and another that would set up an online database tracking state expenses.

Mr. Murdoch has been in the public glare during News Corp.'s efforts to tame the scandal since it mushroomed into a full-blown crisis last July over revelations that the News of the World had hacked into a murdered teen's voice mails.

Before we go there, though, an interesting note to share about the power players involved in Portland: While team president Larry Miller is the front man for owner Paul Allen, league sources say Allen's long-time confidant and member of the team's board of directors, Bert Kolde, is the Wizard of Oz in this process -- one of the most influential voices around who joined Allen and Miller in interviews the last time they tried to fill this job a year ago. • NBA.com's David Aldridge thinks the Wizards should hire Nate McMillan and wishes the Blazers "would just give their general manager's job to Chad Buchanan": The Blazers' collapse this season no doubt reflects poorly on Buchanan; Portland gambled and lost in trading Andre Miller for Ray Felton, and the team was rocked when Brandon Roy retired and Greg Oden suffered one last knee setback that led to his release. But those injuries weren't Buchanan's fault, and he was able to engineer the deal that got Portland a potential top-three pick in the 2012 Draft from New Jersey for Gerald Wallace. Nobody's a harder-working bird dog than Buchanan, and Portland is in need of front office stability, not another new face that has to prove himself to Allen and his people.
Signature drink: The house sangria, $3 per glass during happy hour, is refreshing. The flavors are complex and fruity, but without the overwhelming sweetness inherent to the drink.

NFL Films' Greg Cosell said the 6-foot-3 Luck has an excellent over-the-top throwing motion, which helps him clear the big men in the trenches to complete passes in the middle of the field.

Doug Collins: Revenge is a dish best served 23 years later, when the other team is severely limited by injuries. The Bulls fired Collins in 1989, with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen on the cusp of a generation-defining run. (They hired Phil Jackson. It was probably the right move.) Now, Collins, as 76ers coach, gets back at owner Jerry Reinsdorf by putting the Bulls on the shortlist of one-and-done top seeds.
In the absence of instructions to the contrary, adult children often allow medicine to prolong the dying process. And the default for health care providers is to intervene, both because it's what they're trained to do and as a way of lowering legal liability.

If you know much about the state of contemporary journalism, this will sound like pure folly. It's not meant to be; the book, written in 1998, is set at the turn of the millennium, before Sept. 11, before the 2008 economic crisis. Originally, publishers weren't interested in an amusing book about journalists and terrorism; after 9/11, they didn't want to touch it. But it wasn't the Taliban that informed Shriver's fiction; it was the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which she covered as an American journalist in Belfast.

We'll never know if their mythic quest might have made an accessible movie, for this one offers characters as bleak as its setting -- the sole exception being Michael Caine in a role one size larger than a cameo -- and makes a murky cipher of the plot. What is going on in all those shadows? What's supposed to happen once Theo and his fertile charge reach the ship? The bloated adaptation of P.D. James's thoughtful, compact novel is credited, if you can call it that, to five writers. They were too many, or too few.

When I arrive at work, I just peel off the pants and my work clothes are dry and wrinkle-free, just as I left them.

"Parable" takes that kind of empathy to a new level. The mood is mystical, clarinet and violin often creating quietly ghostly harmonies in high their registers.

If the real question is how often schools suspend students — which obviously affects black students more than other groups — the answer is simple: far too often. Ordinarily, the public thinks of zero tolerance as invoking consequences for drugs or weapons.

The idea is that by removing the troublemaker for a day or more, the school becomes a calmer place where others can achieve.

Clad in a purple shirt that seemed to salute a vintage year for something with a cork in it, Woods sipped a pink drink from an unlabeled water bottle. He used to make millions from Gatorade, which marketed an "eye of the Tiger" flavor array, with Woods' eyes peering out from the label at the consumer. But the company took note of the serial infidelities that shattered Woods' marriage and dropped him like a habit bad enough to require rehab.

Frederick 321 15 — 12 7 1
ALPER: What Republican solutions are you talking about? Haven't heard any. The GOP strategy will be to simply attack Democrats with made-up information. The Obama campaign will likely point out the merits of his plan to turn our country around, highlight accomplishments by saying there's more to be done, and highlight Republican efforts to obstruct progress -- like rejecting his jobs plan. Then they'll point out the extreme views held by the Republicans and how they advocate for the wealthy special interests.
"The boosting market is going to continue to grow," Ken Davis, president of the Americas for Eaton's vehicle group, said at the Center for Automotive Research's annual Management Briefing Seminars.

Never mind that Knight had not made a shot all game. Beckerman knew Knight. He even correctly identified that the play was not designed for Knight to drive to the basket, knowing that there’s a “legend” about Knight in South Florida for a reason.
Unlike Wednesday night when the Cougars blasted Greenville 54-21 in a semifinal game in which they never trailed, the Explorers jumped out to a 3-0 advantage after Central missed its first four shots.

The study suggests leaders organize to support growth in export and innovation industries — from manufacturing to biosciences.
A few weeks later I return to Marble Top Café for lunch. Most of the tables are occupied. My friend orders the vegetarian platter, one that offers the widest variety of items on a single plate. I order the gyro platter  five pre-cut, pressed slices of a beef and lamb mixture, a warm round of pita, tomato, onion and lettuce and tzatziki sauce with a side of saffron rice flecked with raisins and nuts, plus a separate side salad garnished with a dolma.
This state of affairs became strikingly evident a dozen years ago when I was under deadline to complete my second book, a memoir called "Not by Accident: Reconstructing a Careless Life." I would wake at 6, rush to my desk and type frantically, only to drag myself back to bed, exhausted, an hour later. The cycle would repeat itself until the afternoon, when I would leave the house, returning at night so I could go to bed early, sleep for a few hours, get up and do it all again.

A: Kinect's been out 15 months now and that's so short into a platform's life cycle. You look at all the new innovations that have already been done. There's now finger tracking, there's better seated gameplay, the voice is a lot more conversational. In "Kinect Rush," which is a Pixar game, you stand in front of the sensor, it scans you and it instantly creates Pixar-version characters of you in each of the different Pixar universes that are in the game. So you can show up as one of "The Incredibles," or you can show up as a character from "Up."

"The crowd" - which is to say those who were enraged by this turn of events and rose up in a fury of social media - pressured Komen into reversing its decision. Before you knew it, Handel was out, the foundation had been rocked to its core, and though Planned Parenthood's funding has been restored, it's unclear how the foundation can move forward with pro-choice and anti-abortion supporters disappointed.
Of course, dynamics are the 3-series stock in trade, and here the car delivers. The test 335i—with 18-inch all-season radials gripped in the fender wells—practically glided over the crumbly asphalt in the Malibu canyonland with a deeply settled stance that largely quelled bounding and oscillation. The struts-and-multilinks suspension is largely carry-over, but the elastomerics have been tuned to greater ride compliance and better NVH. There's a small trade-off in play here. In hasty corner-to-corner transitions, the car rolled and pitched more than I had expected.
No one is alleging that the student, 23-year-old Daniel Chong, is an angel. He was brought in after a raid in which agents found a large quantity of drugs, including 18,000 ecstasy pills, as well as guns and ammunition. Chong reportedly told the drug agents he had gone to the house to get high.

I had the opportunity to take in two days of the tour. My first day, Tuesday, was at the Bronx's legendary Paradise Theater. The landmark's ornate baroque architecture provided the perfect backdrop for rap's version of the A-Team's Mr. T. But, Rick the Ruler decided to keep it low-key, just a massive diamond-encrusted watch and merely one handful of nugget rings. The setting was intimate, no more than 115 seats tightly arranged around the small stage.
Also, suspenseful advertising -- the Nike ad, for example, featured a talented soccer team dueling with a bunch of demons on the pitch -- also is most effective when viewed in the context of a suspenseful game, the study concluded.

The transition from teen-pop favorite to adult hit-maker is tricky, as is the move from a genre style to a more personal one. Swift is trying to do both at once, and if she stumbles from time to time, we should still be amazed at how gracefully she is handling her maturation in the spotlight.
"Just trying to get more technically sound," Allen said during spring practice. "Better at blitzing, better at coverage.

If we don’t have any lesson learned from this and make any changes, how can we prevent this from happening again."
"And we'll have prime, grass-fed and grass-fed with a corn finish," he said. "My goal is to find the best beef in the country. I can't commit to just locally sourced beef, there isn't enough variety, and I don't know that local producers can keep up. But there is a lot of great beef out there, and the goal is, if you want grass-fed, we'll have it, and if you want prime, we'll have it. It's kind of like how you want your eggs done. People are specific. They want what they like. I know I do."

A government-appointed panel said Thursday that the financial crisis could have been avoided if Wall Street executives and government officials had properly managed risks.

The panel's conclusions had been leaked ahead of its formal report and were widely expected on Wall Street.
There are now two trams from Melbourne on the streets of San Francisco. The one that first attracted my attention was the 1928 W2-class tram.

Its 1920s design is unaltered, aside from a fresh coat of paint and the wheelchair access and GPS navigation system.

I have a soft spot in my heart for old-school areas. I like simple lodges where you can feel the echo of memories that cross generations.

Martin O'Malley and President Barack Obama "have already been successful." In fact, the polls were still open.

Some fellow critics lashed back. The Los Angeles Times' Christopher Knight, in a lengthy 1991 critique, called Kramer "the Little Dutch Boy of art criticism," whose writings were futile efforts to hold back the tide of "Pop artists, Minimalists, Conceptualists and other horrid children of the 1960s." A few years later, critic Peter Plagens wrote in Newsweek that Kramer was the critic the art world reads "like crazy, even if it's by flashlight, under the blankets."

Look, I recognize that most of the Republicans in Congress have said no to just about every policy I've proposed since taking office. And on some issues, I realize it's because there are genuine philosophical differences. But on issues like this one, the only reason they're holding this up is politics, pure and simple. They're making the same calculation they made just before the inauguration: if I fail, they win. Well, they might think this will get them where they need to go in November, but it won't get our country where it needs to go in the long run.

Even amid chaos there are rules to the game, and the rules that Reza advances are a lot like the rules of farce, which are also the rules of good television situation comedy. Each contestant carries an easily identifiable stamp, which in this case is typed, casually and almost lazily, by job description. Alan is a lawyer (think shark). Veronica is an art lover and writer of books and articles about tragedies in Africa (think overprivileged meddler). Michael operates a wholesale company, handling household goods (think uncultured business guy). Annette is a wealth manager (think what you will). These are caricatures, but as Arndt’s fine cast reveals, they are caricatures with more than a pound to flesh out. All four neatly pull off that most difficult of actorly challenges: They make you like their characters even as you actively detest them.

We see many dance styles in the show, all performed with aplomb. But the centerpiece is Jessica Lee Goldyn's performance of "The Music and the Mirror," a solo of throbbing individuality. Though it hints at the disco style of the era (in which the show is still set), it's a personal celebration.

He wrote symphonies and concertos, solos and chamber music that were accessible rather than academic, and perhaps that's why his music fell out of style.

Defendants typically have an initial appearance before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. On weekends, those appearances are at 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., the lawsuit says. The suit says a Sheriff's Office official picked up a pro-tem judge to give Keys an immediate initial appearance and, upon his release, drove him back to Country Thunder. The suit claims the Sheriff's Office administration and Lt. Blake King, who was on duty and filed a report on the incident months later, tried to steer the investigation because the suspect was a friend of Tucson police and several witnessing Tucson officers claimed it was a "bad arrest."

Pujols may have trouble in the American League this year, if there isn't some presence behind (and ahead of) him in the lineup. For the last 11 seasons, he has been hitting in front of the likes of McGwire, Edmonds, Rolen, Holilday and Berkman every year. He may not get many pitches to hit. I don't think Pujols' numbers here were affected by his contract.
A high-ranking police source said Keesee's demotion to her permanent rank of captain came after White ordered a forensic search of department computers to track an annonymous letter that circulated in department circles recently.

Voters should be especially watchful and sober-minded as the primary season plays out. What's in a candidate's resume to suggest change?

All three may still cling to the unlikely prospect that together they can siphon off enough delegate support in the remaining state contests to keep Mr. Romney from reaching the magic number of 1,144 votes required to be nominated. They may still dream of a replay of the brokered conventions of 1920 that gave Gov. James M. Cox of Ohio the Democratic nomination on the 44th ballot and Sen. Warren G.

Linda Wilson: A traffic analysis was done to look at potential improvements to I-270. I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for, but it was given a thorough review by our engineers. We are adding a lane of capacity so drivers can expect traffic to flow better than it does now. I would not expect it to be free flow 60+ mph at rush hour, but it should be better than the stand still it is today. You are right there is a bigger issue of needing more north-south options. St. Louis County is doing a mid-county study through our regional metropolitan planning organization looking at that very issue.

For example, explore the sequence of dreams in Matthew chapters 1-3. Remember how Joseph has been scandalized by the news that Mary has become pregnant. Her pregnancy brings shame to his family's good name. Yet it appears that Joseph harbors no ill feelings toward Mary. Instead, righteously and quietly, Joseph searches for answers. His life has become ringed by terror and scandal, and the options seem impossible, even hopeless. There is no grace, just fear and anxiety.

“It does deal with a playwright who had a production in Nantucket and didn’t attend,” he says. “The play, however, is really about change, which is the scariest thing in the world. Not just because we can change our lives, but also how change can invade our lives. No matter how much we want to hold on, change will come in like some runaway fighter jet that crashes into a housing development.”

Left side of line, plus Mack, is fine. Pinkston made strides as a rookie last season. Questions remain about Lauvao’s viability for the long haul, and right tackle screams for a high draft pick. Cousins only is listed as the starter because Browns parted ways with Tony Pashos, who was injured and played poorly last season. If Vikings go against prognostications and pass on Matt Kalil at No. 3, Browns would have a crack at him. Sliding Kalil to right tackle, though, means he would not play the position that is tied to his best value. Right tackles simply should not be going in the top five. At 37, Browns possibly could have two of these three in front of them: Jonathan Martin, Mike Adams and Bobby Massie. If the Browns stay at 4, 22 and 37, and pass on RT each time, Mitchell Schwartz and/or Zerbie Sanders might still be on the board when they pick early in the third round.

MJ Bread is sold at Tammie Coe Cakes and MJ Breads, tammiecoecakes.com for stores, and at La Grande Orange Grocery in Phoenix and Oakville Grocery in Scottsdale. The topiary, $26.50, and vintage horse plaque, $20, are from Found.

But, at a time when City Hall is weathering a storm of controversy over failures in its $1.15 billion lease of all city parking meters, the numbers also show that fewer motorists are making the effort to challenge citations—less than 5 percent so far this year.

During its heyday, 3,000 residents lived here despite blistering summer temperatures.

A major difference from the Iraq war run-up is that so many military leaders have spoken out against war. Most former or present Israeli military and intelligence leaders oppose an attack, one or more pointing out that: Iran is not an "existential threat" to Israel; an attack would push Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon; the attack would only delay such development by one to three years; and the repercussions could be disastrous.

Unfortunately, voters — and therefore the legislators who represent them — are unlikely to want to give the new revenue to the amorphous general fund or directly to the colleges to spend. Tuition reduction, by contrast, is a clear, tangible, readily understood benefit. The idea of bringing University of California tuition back down to a nostalgia-invoking $4,000 a year (instead of the current $12,000) is naturally appealing.
The laughable monster in "Curse of the Demon" (1957, a.k.a. "Night of the Demon") can reportedly be blamed on meddling producers. Otherwise this Jacques Tourneur-directed spookfest is genuinely scary from the opening shots of Stonehenge and a drive through a menacing forest to its finish. Dana Andrews stars as a skeptical American scientist investigating a series of murders connected to a purported devil cult and its leader (Niall MacGinnis). The film screens with "Burn, Witch, Burn" (1962), in which a psychology professor discovers that black magic is behind his academic achievements.

They figure out what's not original to the Iron Age-era city and tear down walls to uncover the original structures, and determine the purposes of a room and how it may have looked back in the Iron Age.
The pre-development tasks, including environmental reviews, threatened to get sidetracked when the Maloofs said this week they wouldn't put in $3.2 million toward those expenses.

It is a modern-heavy list because there are more playoff rounds now than there were back in the day. More than half of the list played the heart of its career during the go-go 1980s, when every playoff series was Flyers-Penguins 2012. But it remains, almost entirely, a collection of real and true hockey royalty — great players who stayed great, even in the cauldron of spring.

If you are having a party, or plan to stay in to watch a Boris Karloff movie marathon, here is a spiffy coaster idea to add to the eerie atmosphere.
If Mr. Santorum reciprocates, maybe not immediately, but eventually, the healing of the divisive primary campaign will have been achieved. If Mr. Santorum does the job well enough, he could find himself in a Romney cabinet, say, secretary of Health and Human Services, where he could focus on those moral and cultural issues about which he cares so much. Or, he might even be Mr. Romney's choice for vice president. There have been stranger bedfellows in American politics.

Gorgonzola-Stuffed Dates combine salty, pungent cheese with toasty almonds or walnuts in another do-ahead dessert nibble that can also shine on a cheese display or as an hors d'oeuvre. The Gorgonzola lends salt to the sweet date, while the nut adds crunch; using walnuts instead of almonds gives a hint of tannin, which can help offset tannins when paired with a young vintage port. Ruby port and late harvest Zinfandel are other dessert wine choices for the stuffed dates.
In the fourth quarter, senior Khadijah Young took over. She scored 17 of her 19 points in the final quarter, including hitting nine of 11 foul shots.

I realize it's rich of me to declare that an advice-slinger is not responsible for any advisory fallout. But the nature of advice and the fact of adult autonomy combine to reduce your liability here to almost nothing. You say you thought it was good advice; if you gave it with care and without a hidden agenda, then you served as nothing more than one of many sources of information.

The militants, believed to be followers of former jihadist groups, lie at the outer edge of the Islamist movement.

Ward, now 35, grew up in DeLisle, a rural town near Mississippi's coast that served as the basis for the setting in "Salvage the Bones." It is her lodestone; when I talk to her on the phone, she's there, staying at her mother's house. "People ask me about staying here. I think they assume that I wouldn't want to come back to a place like Mississippi, which is so backward and which frustrates me a lot," she says. "The responsibility that I feel to tell these stories about the people and the place that I'm from is what pulls me back."

Those were accusations that hurt her. The 1980s weren't the so-called "post-racial" moment of now. (The "post-racial" moment doesn't actually exist for black women. Our traditional role is to be the keepers of the community, so we face far greater penalties for attempting to invent our own forms of blackness.)

There’s always a gap between what public officials say to the “gotcha” media and what they actually must do — especially when it comes to terrorism.

Any doubt that pig is big in the world’s most populous country would be erased by a visit to a Chinese food market such as Top Quality Food Market in Parsippany.

The tough thing baseball faces is it's such a traditional game. It's in American DNA. But they gotta speed that game up. If you're thinking about baseball long-term, it's too slow of a game. And it's too many trips to the pitcher's mound and too much stepping out of the batter's box. I have a hard time -- I love baseball, but -- sitting through a five-hour game.
The company's growth strategy -- expanding in the more lucrative and less-regulated pipeline and gas storage businesses -- is also predicated on volatile prices and increasing demand for natural gas.

2. New York Red Bulls: F Thierry Henry and Red Bulls finally looking like a conference contender. What took so long?
We have said from the beginning of this acrimonious discussion that Ohio's collective bargaining laws for public employees -- pushed through a Democrat-run legislature and signed by a very pro-labor Gov. Richard F. Celeste in 1983 -- should be changed to reflect new economic realities and to give state and local officials greater management flexibility. Ending the strict rule, now enshrined in Ohio law, that schools must use seniority in determining layoffs would, on its own, be a huge help to urban school districts that are betting on innovative schools -- often staffed by relatively new, creative teachers -- to lift student performance. That's the kind of reform that Mayor Frank Jackson, new Cleveland schools CEO Eric Gordon and backers of the district's transformation plan want and need.

Apparently, for these sportsmen, the game isn't dangerous enough, the risk of injury too low.

Special Master Elizabeth McKenzie has reported that the property is suitable for building. Superior Court Judge Lisa Chrystal has said that a 360-unit building, which will contain some affordable units and a parking garage to service that building, should be built.

Craig and Freese hit their homers in back-to-back at-bats against Arizona reliever Bryan Shaw. According to the tracker, Craig's bolt left his bat at 104.8 mph and Freese's left his at 106.3 mph. (The top exit speed for a homer so far this season is Travis Hafner's homer against Kansas City's Luis Mendoza on April 15. That left his bat at 117.2 mph.)

(Holliday's homer had an apex of 126 feet, which is 60 feet more than a home run he hit earlier this month at Busch.) That gives you a sense of the detail to which Hit Tracker has always calculated homers and, yes, it's a lot of numbers to describe a base hit that really results in the only number that matters: a run.

John Harbaugh said at the end of 2010 that one of the reasons the Ravens didn't blitz as much under Mattison is because he just didn't feel comfortable leaving the Ravens corners alone in single coverage. That's understandable, but sometimes it makes sense to take risks, even if you get burned, because of the physical and mental wear and tear it puts on a quarterback. At one point in the fourth quarter, Sanchez actually tried to duck as he was throwing the football he was so weary of getting hit. That's how in his head the rush was.

"The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass" makes you cry. I couldn't go through the pages without weeping. I didn't go through anything like he did, not for my skin color.

Job No. 1 is improving energy efficiency. Enormous waste is embedded in our buildings, homes and factories. Over the next 10 years, we can replace and remodel old, inefficient machines and equipment and make all new buildings completely energy efficient.

This being a Rothko show, there has to be plenty of Rothko's color-saturated, transcendental abstractions. And there are. But Guenther also found crucial early works that dutifully trail the artist's gradual transition from representative painter to Abstract Expressionist, and from canvases filled with figures and objects to those absent of them entirely. If there's a quibble, it's that he doesn't clarify why Rothko made these transitions. The artist was an uncompromising, even unyielding, searcher for artistic truth and self-definition. But the roots of that existential journey aren't articulated fully enough.

Several commissioners questioned the timing of the ballot initiative, saying it should be geared toward a general election when more voters would be expected to participate and not during the August primary as this attempt would be. Many of the same commissioners also questioned the fate of art in a museum owned by the financially struggling City of Detroit that would, in part, become funded by Macomb County taxpayers. Erickson sought to assure commissioners that the art would be protected from sale regardless of Detroits situation, said the cost of a millage campaign in a general election would be prohibitive and told commissioners that Macomb County residents would get free admission to the museum if they approve a millage.
The judge said the automated system "is a drastic departure from the traditional police powers granted to municipalities; and as seen here, it raises a whole host of legal and constitutional issues."

Here's what happened: A couple of episodes ago, The Situation and wingman Pauly Delvecchio were entertaining two ladies at the house; The Situation was making progress with a brunette named Alex, while Pauly D merely tried to keep her blonde friend placated. Didn't work. The never-named blonde barged in on The Situation and Alex in his bedroom and convinced Alex to leave. This week, The Situation runs into Alex again and invites her back to the house. She shows up with the blonde and a bigger blonde. The Situation does what any strapping young man would do -- he asks the 4'10" girl to ask them to leave. Snooki firmly but not overly rudely tells the two blondes to scram. Alex leaves with them, and one of them mutters something nasty to Snooki on their way out. Snooki barges after them, demanding to be insulted to her face. (Personally, I've never understood that impulse. I'd much rather be insulted behind my back.)
From the handsome, rock-walled dining room, diners can see shadows of people bending, flexing and stretching through the translucent glass of the mezzanine studio. Owner Sandy Lawrence, a businesswoman who also owns Lion's Run Winery in Napa, devised the seemingly odd combination, but she's done everything to ensure success by hiring Ed Puccio, formerly the general manager of Jack Falstaff in San Francisco, as Ubuntu's general manager. As with Greens, some of the produce served comes from the restaurant's own garden, off Monticello Road, and diners will find unfamiliar ingredients such as ice plant, root beer leaves and vegetable flowers.

The Internet makes it nearly impossible to choose other ways to live, without being confronted all the time with the previous ways you thought about things. So, fundamentally, behind the principle of a right to be forgotten is this idea that you shouldn't judge a child on its childish behavior 20 years later.
Whenever Molloy needed a big goal, he provided it. The athletic junior forward had the game-sealing tally in a 3-2 win over Holy Cross in the CHSAA Class AA intersectional quarterfinals and had his team’s lone goal in a 1-1 tie with eventual champ St. Francis Prep in the regular season.

Just 26 percent of Republicans say their impression of the GOP field has improved as they have learned more about the candidates, largely unchanged since December.
As a busy television actor, Benzali for many years had been based in Los Angeles, but says he “never felt totally at home there.

But on Aug. 20 the point of the bill changed sharply, to its current form, and a sponsor appeared: California Retailers Association, an influential trade group representing retailers that operate over 9,000 stores and generate more than $100 billion annually in the state. Inside the halls of the capital it has been dubbed "The Walmart Bill." The lobbyist working AB1581, Bob Giroux, represents Walmart, which has spent $246,750 since last year on his firm, Lang, Hansen, O'Malley & Miller. Garrick Brown, a retail industry analyst with Colliers International, said the bill's perimeters fit perfectly with Walmart's most recent expansion efforts. Notably, the size specification noted in the bill -- 120,000 square feet -- is precisely Walmart's typical footprint.

They apparently restrained themselves from hurling them.
"The bottom line is, you want to come out with impact players," Elway said at this morning's news conference. "As I said last year, drafting to need is, you have a lot more misses, in my mind, when you draft to need.

Those, of course, are the most famous lyrics in Rangers history, a 53-word monologue that time and legend have boiled down to one: “guarantee.” That was Mark Messier speaking on the afternoon of Tuesday, May 24, 1994, in the aftermath of the Rangers losing a disheartening Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the Devils.
It would be a mistake, however, to let all this praise go to our collective heads or allow our communal pride to be wounded by the occasional less-than-flattering ranking. The stats used to determine results are often sketchy and usually highly subjective.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like. But I just don't feel right about carrying on the name King Crimson.

Clackamas County Service District No. 1 serves Happy Valley, Damascus and a large portion of urban, unincorporated north Clackamas County. It also serves the city of Milwaukie as a wholesale customer through the Kellogg Creek plant.
Grassley's amendment is indeed written too broadly, applying to far more exchanges of information than the sort done for hedge funds and stock traders. But the pursuit of political intelligence is a potentially corrupting force, given the value that stock traders may place on insights from inside Congress or the administration. For example, being the first to know about a new tax break that's been slipped into a bill could enable a trader to profit when the rest of the market finds out and reacts. Doing so might involve a consultant posing as a concerned constituent, or buying enough goodwill to obtain the kind of access to lawmakers, aides and documents that the general public doesn't get.
Splunk was founded eight years ago by a trio of engineers, Erik Swan, Rob Das and Baum.

Daniel Craig stars as a loving husband and father of two girls who relocates his family to a beautiful home in a small New England town, only to suspect that all is not as it seems. Rachel Weisz, Craig's real-life wife, also plays his movie wife here, giving the film some extra naturalism.

--LF Brett Gardner, who was placed on the disabled list after straining his right elbow while making a diving catch Tuesday, said he made the injury a little worse when he attempted to take batting practice the next day. "I'm on the 15-day DL, so there's no point in me trying to hit in two or three days. I'd like to be hitting in eight to 10 days in a perfect scenario," Gardner said Thursday. "That would put me on track to come off the DL on time."

It turns out that experts have been fretting about tired children since at least 1897. According to an article published online Monday by the journal Pediatrics, 32 sets of sleep guidelines for kids – containing 360 distinct recommendations for children of specific ages – were published between 1897 and 2009. During that time, the amount of recommended sleep fell by an average of 0.71 minutes per year. That added up to about 70 fewer minutes of suggested nightly sleep over the course of the 20th century.

Still, his 17-for-28 (.607) opening against lefties this season is outrageous, even for small sample sizes.

Stand Up Paddle (SUP) is all about having fun, kind of how surfing used to be before it began to get so popular, the surf spots getting crazy crowded, the "I have to be the only one on this wave" mentality and the little or no toleration for other surfers. What happened to the Love? Do we surf, however we chose to do it, because we love it? Or is it because we don't know why but are driven, for unfathomable reasons, to be there as often as possible, to ride waves but willing to lower ourselves to any level to accomplish that?
"There is no policy specific to hugging, and we have not, nor will we be, suspending students for hugging," he said in a written statement.

Only four patrol offices -- Portland, Salem, Central Point and Bend -- reached the 24/7 standard, and that was on paper. The hiring didn't account for gaps caused by vacations, training and other absences. The new bodies went first to offices along Interstate 5, then along I-84 and U.S. 97, through Central Oregon. Coastal offices along U.S. 101 were to be next for more troopers.

All five companies that bid on the project have experienced escapes and other issues at other prisons they operate. All of the companies are supposed to disclose, in their bids, any escapes, homicides, assaults on staff or inmates, riots or other disturbances, and various other issues at any prisons they operate. That history, however, accounts for less than five percent of the point total in the criteria used to evaluate the bids.

There's a nuanced flavor running through Autumn Martin's s'mores cookies. Is that bacon? Not quite. In order to replicate the char of marshmallows roasted over a campfire, the Seattle-based pastry pro smokes chocolate chips with alder wood and adds them to her batter. The former overseer of Theo Chocolate's kitchen has been mastering this maneuver for the past five years. Now, with her new company, Hot Cakes—purveyor of decadent jarred desserts, over-the-top salted caramels and cookies—she has found other ways to apply the technique. Ms. Martin sells the chips separately so that adventurous sweet-crafters can experiment at will. Suggested applications include incorporating the smoky nibs into a ganache, which can then be blended into a Scotch milkshake, grinding them into savory meat rubs, using them for a mousse or simply melting them into a drizzle-on for buttered toast. $9 for three cookies, $14 per 8-ounce bag of chips, getyourhotcakes.com
A: Hey, Fred: First, Pat Riley had a long-term plan, is very smart and cleared the most cap space in NBA history. Second, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James are basically paying Miller and Haslem by accepting less than market-value max. It was like intrateam revenue sharing, saving the owner money and costing the players, which did not make the union happy. As for Ilgauskas, he signed a minimum contract for $1.4 million. Teams over the salary cap have the option of signing as many minimum players as they want. Not only that, the league pays a portion of those minimum contracts.

But according to Andreu Mas-Colell, Catalonia's economy minister, the real story is a little different. He explains that with the exception of the Basque Country, Spain's 17 regions enjoy spending autonomy but almost no revenue autonomy.

This time, there are a series of deadlines this year, starting with the CVC's mandate to deliver a plan by Feb. 1. The Rams could counteroffer and would have to do so by May 1. If the two sides can't strike a deal, they will meet in arbitration starting June 15 and, if needed, through the end of December. An arbitrator can't force the CVC to fund improvements to the Dome but can determine whether the plans pushed by either side - or a combination of the two - would make the Dome a first-tier stadium.

New York Police Department bomb experts later determined Shahzad had used a type of fertilizer that wasn't volatile enough to explode like the ammonium nitrate grade fertilizer used in previous terrorist bombings.

At Kwik Trip, employee loyalty and retention are driven, in part, by a benefits package that includes profit sharing. Under the plan, 40 percent of pretax profits are distributed to full-time and part-time employees. Last year, that resulted in a 9 percent year-end bonus plus a 4.5 percent company contribution to individual 401(k) plans. Full-time employees also get a cut of Kwik Trip's real estate holdings in the form of shares after five years of service.

The site is the brainchild of Wade, the founder and CEO of other dating websites like SeekingArrangement.com and WhatsYourPrice.com. Born in Singapore, Wade describes himself as a "nerd" growing up, lonely and afraid of talking to women. He says his mother advised him to study hard to achieve the "financial means to be generous." Studies at MIT followed, where he found his first girlfriend and first kiss at 21. Afterwards Wade decided to use his tech skills to implement his mother's advice. He created SeekingArrangment.com to pair "sugar daddies" up with female "sugar babies" who want to be pampered. It's also where Wade met his wife.

In the meantime, the possibility that the court’s ruling could stand has sent outside groups scrambling for ways to avoid revealing their financial backers.

Mr. Romney is hardly the first Republican presidential aspirant to take that tack against a Democratic incumbent. In 1980, Ronald Reagan zeroed in on Jimmy Carter's competence. Plenty of Americans thought President Carter was a good and decent man too—but by election day Mr. Reagan had persuaded them that his rival just wasn't up to the job.
As Katz testified Tuesday morning, he was "the guy." He was in charge of everything. That included the money and the books.

Fans should remain grounded, however. Do not expect the Cavs to be able to just trade for a star player with it. They can break it into pieces and, frankly, that is what is most likely. They may use it to absorb mid-level players in salary-cap clearing trades to pick up extra draft picks or prospects from teams looking to dump money.

2007 Bogle Vineyards Pinot Noir, Russian River Valley, California ($12-$14) - The big trend now is making deep, dark-colored Pinots that could very well be blended with Syrah and are yammy-jammy rich. This Bogle is a throwback. Its color is light, and the aroma has a delicate, light cherry tone with a little spice and wild strawberry. The taste is very smooth, with no hard edges. This is a super-easy and quaffable Pinot with appealing fruit character and just enough structure to keep it lively. 87 points
Moyer said that everything feels at least as good as it did in his last full season, 2009 with the Phillies. He rebounds from starts as easily. He throws with no pain. His location is precise, and his pitches break the way they always did. And he doesn't feel 49 years old doing it all. If this season goes well, he sounds as if he could envision playing another.
For the record, Jagr appeared as stunned as Briere did. No one saw this coming after the way the Flyers skated in Game 1. "Tonight, it looked like they had the legs and we didn’t," Jagr said, quietly. He really was baffled.

I previewed the tool before it went live and searched for fees by airline in several categories: baggage, ticket booking and change, seating selection and boarding, unaccompanied minor, pets and other. The better use of this tool is to create comparisons by selecting options -- such as a single checked bag or seat selection -- and see how the airline fees stack up. (Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines are among the few carriers that charge for carry-on, as NerdWallet's tool shows.)
Senate Republicans refused to confirm anyone to head the new agency, demanding changes in its governance first. They said the Dodd-Frank bill put too much unbridled power in a single director, a recipe for abuse.

"I think that to say some guys are bold ­ guys aren't going to have a hang-dog look and say "Well, we might win." Guys are confident that we're going to win," Reese said. "I think all players in the National Football League do that, I just think it"s over-exaggerated."

Where Loyola can steal an edge: Justin Drummond, a 6-4 guard, was the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Sixth Man of the Year, the fifth Greyhound to win the award in Pastos' eight seasons.

Cold air made a difference, too. At around 40 degrees Fahrenheit, flu virus infected guinea pigs at humidities that stopped infections at room temperature. Infected animals shed virus two days longer at the colder temperature, perhaps because noses can't shed virus as effectively when mucus is colder and thicker.

Gingrich thrived for a while in January. His candor won him supporters in the seemingly endless string of Republican debates. But his ex-wife Marianne said Gingrich had offered her a choice of an open marriage or a divorce, and at a debate two days before South Carolina's Jan. 21 primary, CNN's John King asked Gingrich about the report. The question, the candidate snarled, was "as close to despicable as anything I can imagine." The audience applauded loudly, and Gingrich won the state's primary.

Biology and baseball are widely different pursuits, but both benefit from copious, thoughtful data gathering. We should keep in mind that the data we collect today could someday bear fruit when analyzed in currently unimagined ways. As with biological data, honest, precise and complete baseball data will help extend the limits of human physiology and anatomy -- and perhaps allow some future Sandy Koufax to throw another legendary game.
Most racing teams, whether they compete in NASCAR, IndyCar or Formula One, are constantly looking for ways to raise money through sponsorships. Patrick's marketability has certainly helped her career in this regard (you'll probably never see IndyCar stars Dario Franchitti or Will Power on a Super Bowl commercial), but she is approaching the point of her career when on-track results will need to weigh more than her marketing appeal.

The NBA early entry deadline is April 10. I don't think Burke will leave -- as talented as he is, he is a 5-11 freshman guard in a deep draft. He is not smitten by the NBA like previous point guard Darius Morris (and the voices in Morris' ear). I don't think Burke will leave until he is a sure first-round pick, at minimum -- and right now, he is probably a second-round pick.

The limited number of games played in international soccer—most nations play about a dozen each season, of which half are friendlies—means there is little time available to develop tactical cohesion.

Why is spit so full of information? Saliva contains proteins, enzymes, hormones and DNA. That's why the cholesterol spit-test won't be the only one you'll see in the next few years. One of the most exciting saliva tests in development is a reliable screening for the inflammation marker called C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP can indicate heart disease — or an impending heart attack — and tracking changing levels can let doctors and patients check on how well cardio treatments are working. That can speed recovery after a heart attack or other cardiac problems. And eventually, many important health risk factors — including stress; exposure to harmful chemicals in the air, water or food; a person's history of infectious disease; and of course oral health — may be measured this way.

No one can question his sincerity, or his integrity. Bing was a winner on the basketball court and a persevering force in the tough automotive supply business.
Eventually a new decade began, a more conservative culture took hold, and the trend sputtered out. Sean S. Cunningham, who had produced “Last House,” turned to the blood-on-white-bread horrors of the “Friday the 13th” series; Wes Craven, who had directed “Last House” (and “Hills”) moved on to the surreal psychology of “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and the self-mockery of “Scream.” The good-ol’-boy beasts seemed to come to a quiet end.
Beckham has been plagued by a series of nagging injuries and didn't make the trip. Landon Donovan returned from a quadriceps injury that kept him out of the Galaxy's 3-1 home loss to New England.
Meanwhile, the owners who had promoted themselves as champions of urban renewal recognized what everyone else knew years earlier: The state Legislature was never going to agree to their demands for $235 million to build a new arena, so they cashed out for $300 million in 2004 — twice the amount they paid for the franchise.

This is not to lump these rear guardsmen with the remarkable Montreal groups of the late '60s and early '70s. The Blues aren't "Les Habs." But they potentially "Les Have" a formidable facsimile in years ahead.
His critics also cite it as evidence that he is too preoccupied with his national image and not mindful enough of residents' concerns in his own city.
"I still think about it," he said. "For three years it was ingrained in my brain about worrying about my feet. I'm thinking about it. But I'm not close to worrying about it now."

For example, if she seems positive, you can reinforce that: "I'm pleased to hear that you're feeling good about joining us -- maintaining a positive attitude is very important to the team."
Woods was two under until a bogey-bogey finish left him with an even-par 72. A snap hook into the trees left of No.18 was his fourth of the day — two of which forced him to take a penalty drop.

When the 27-year-old Adam, a nervous type who works for public radio in Seattle, finds out that the mysterious pains in his back come from a malignant tumor growing by his spinal column, he is understandably disbelieving. When he's told his chances of surviving are 50-50, he is aghast, but best friend and co-worker Kyle sees things differently. "If you were a casino game," he insists, "you'd have the best odds."
When we determine that people did not act of their own free will, such as when a person is legally insane, we excuse that person from the consequences of their actions.
It wasn't immediately clear what chance ShowMe has of getting the city to sign on.
"It's awful," he says of the dwindling number of venues on newsprint. "If there was one paper left, I'd still do it every week. I don't know if I would be able to do it if it was only online. That would be tough. No deadline? I don't think I'd do it."
Bloomberg's office told him the proposal was just in a conceptual stage, Christie said, and they would get back to them later. In a Monday night radio appearance, Christie said he had not spoken to Bloomberg about the proposed subway extension.

"I really think that Penney's is just struggling to survive," she said. "Penney's needs to be different, and price doesn't do that. Their merchandise isn't at all unique or differentiated.

9."Gossip Girl" (series), by Cecily Von Ziegesar (drugs; offensive language; sexually explicit).
We began in the Welsh market town of Hay-on-Wye, where it took some willpower to escape into the hills. Hay is home to at least 30 used and specialty bookstores, and its tangled warren of streets is lined with open-air bookcases sagging under the weight of tempting volumes. But any acquisitions would have to ride on our backs for the next 65 miles, so we followed the River Wye out of town, reluctantly unencumbered.
That's why people focus on startups. If the next Microsoft gets born here, it's much more likely to stay. It does seem, though, that we could do a better job connecting our college grad/young adult population with the companies that are in need of their skills.
The campaign-as-warfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse. It may make sense if you think today's swing voters hunger for more combat, more harshness and more attack. But it's probably bad sociology and terrible psychology, given the general disgust with conventional politics. If I were in the campaigns, I'd want to detach from the current approach and change the nature of the campaign. If I were Obama, I'd play to his personal popularity and run an "American Idol" campaign: likability, balance, safety and talent. If I were Romney, saddled with his personal diffidence, I'd run a plumber campaign: You may not love me, but here's four things I can do for you.
Seligman said the group of demonstrators plans to turn the two-story building into a homeless shelter with medical services and food.
Before the boom, the region's affordability rating was already considered high at 115 percent. Now, the rating is a record 163, because of lower home prices and interest rates, but that's still not enough to draw many buyers.
Police did not say what the attacker stole from Musial.
"Saying you're going to do something and doing it are two entirely different things," he said. "There's no business model that we can detect."
How it works: You and a friend get into what looks like a cab, except there seems to be no meter. The driver says it will be $10 to your destination. You agree, except that when you arrive, the driver says, Oh, he meant $10 each. A variation of this is that the driver says the place you're headed is no longer in business, and he suggests an alternative, usually a place owned by his friend. Or, you wind up being taken "the long way" in an unfamiliar city to inflate a metered fare.
Cash reserves increased from $9.6 billion at the end of 2011 to $11.3 billion as of March 31.

The following day, the challenge continued, with more people paddling out as the waves became more manageable. One novice headed straight for my head with his board.
In this case, it was a summer youth employment program designed to provide work experience to at-risk teens.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that House Democrats share Obama's "commitment to providing the middle class with a tax cut to grow the economy and create jobs." She noted that a House-passed bill, which Republicans blocked in the Senate, did not include "a bonus tax cut to millionaires and billionaires."

WASHINGTON -- Northwest lawmakers sided with the majority as Congress voted to allow people to carry loaded guns in national parks and wildlife refuges.

Through most of their nine-game trip to start the season, the Indians had that working for them. In yesterday's 7- 2 loss to Texas in the home opener at Jacobs Field, all they had on their side was the weather.
"What I'd like to do is to come back and offer a sense of normalcy and get business running and stable and give the community the power to elect whoever they want," Steele said. "It has to go back to the community."
Shame on Rev. Jamal Bryant and the mayoral candidates for trashing Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake because she was absent from the mayoral debate on August 2 ( "Candidates focus on schools, crime," Aug 3). As a city resident, I want my mayor to be out with communities during annual grassroots events like National Night Out, not campaigning. The mayor was right to attend these events, spending time with neighborhoods who fight to reduce crime. It's surprising that the candidates did not take advantage of these numerous events throughout the city to campaign. Perhaps they and whoever chose the date for the debate are the ones out of touch and do not understand what's important to city residents.
But like so many other agencies that begin with good intentions, the Department of Homeland Security has swelled to massive proportions at a huge cost to taxpayers. The billion-dollar question — $55 billion, if you consider 2013 funding levels — is whether we can achieve an acceptable comfort level at a much lower expense. As we continue to face mounting national debt, cutting expenses where possible should be Congress's priority for every department.
“In the beginning I just kicked it,” Popek said. “When I learned the technique it got easier.”
That is the premise of John Cariani’s “Almost, Maine,” on stage at Cuyahoga Community College’s Western Campus. The play is a series of nine vignettes about people who live very close to the northern lights, and it apparently affects their feelings, especially in the love and romance departments.
If convicted, the singer faced sentences ranging up to nearly five years in prison.
A Quaint Furniture was one of the lines made by Stickley Brothers Co. of Grand Rapids, Mich. The company was founded in 1891 by John George and Albert Stickley. Their Quaint Line of furniture was introduced in 1902. Quaint Mission was made first. Other Quaint lines included Quaint Arts & Crafts (1904), Quaint Tudor (1914), Quaint Manor (1914), Quaint American (1920s) and Quaint Colonial (1920s). John George left the firm in 1902 and Albert retired in 1927. The company remained in business until about 1947. Your vanity in good condition is worth about $300.
In the end, the last best hope for stopping Iran's dominance of the region may be a Republican victory in 2012 -- and a new administration with guts enough to stand by Israel and to work out a new strategy for dealing with Iran, nukes or no nukes.
Hey, Tony: Will Randy Lerner ever address the fans? Obviously Tom Heckert has failed in two drafts. Mike Holmgren obviously is past his prime. His hiring of Pat Shurmur is a joke. Lerner should refund season-ticket holders. This franchise embodies ineptitude at all levels and they don't even seem to care. Why is that? Obviously the only chance for us to succeed is to force Lerner to sell the team. -- James Heneghan, Swedesboro, N.J.

When David was 6, his father died. Vern Jacobs became his stepfather six years later. A widower since David's mother died in 2008, Jacobs underwent triple-bypass heart surgery about two years ago, "so we really have to watch the sodium now when we take him out to eat," a change that can benefit all of them, David says.
Ryan Seacrest, who took over main hosting duties on the countdown show from Clark after years of working beside the legend, said in a statement Wednesday that he was "deeply saddened."
Don't worry, my friend, my community and I are doing a lot more than just hitting "like" buttons on Facebook to show our loyalty.
But research by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California has shown that relatively few jobs move into or out of the state in any given year. Although numbers are not available for the most recent years, data for 1992 through 2006 showed that about 16,000 jobs per year moved into California from elsewhere while 25,000 moved out. That's a net decline of about 9,000 jobs per year, a tiny fraction of the state's base of more than 15 million jobs overall.
As Councilman Bill Spence paraphrased Wednesday, those who fail to plan, plan to fail.
But here in Minnesota, Dayton and other Democrats can't seriously mean to argue both that the policies of George Bush, who left office three years ago, are wholly responsible for today's continuing national recession, and that the policies of Tim Pawlenty, who left office 11 months ago, have had nothing whatever to do with Minnesota's above-average recovery over the past four years.

Cuyahoga County voters took a huge step toward a better future on Nov. 3 when they overwhelmingly approved a charter containing a new blueprint for government. But passing Issue 6 was only the first step. Now the new structure has to work for the good of the public.
Those who need to stuff child seats or Costco pallets into their hatchbacks should pass up the 500 for a roomier set of cheap wheels. From Ford to Hyundai, the market has plenty of them. Fiat's offering seems destined for niche appeal -- the automaker's expectation of 50,000 U.S. and Canadian sales in 2011 sounds overly optimistic -- but the car's styling and nimble handling could win a group of younger enthusiasts.
Hansen said police are leading the investigation and TriMet hasn't even been able to examine the bus or onboard video because they have been seized. At a news conference Wednesday morning, Hansen said he was "deeply saddened" by the death of the women.

Rep. Sandra Williams, a black Cleveland Democrat who heads the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, said a GOP offer to draw black voters together into districts unifying cities wasn't enough for her caucus, primarily because it didn't alter the map's 12-to-4 ratio of Republican-to-Democratic districts.
Sharptown Road was closed between High Hill and Center Square roads, but no one was evacuated, police said.

"I wish I had that man. Everybody does," said Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen in something of a Wednesday concession speech. "You're fighting against a city and an organization he's played for all his life."
What shouldn't be in the deal: Tax increases. "I firmly believe raising taxes right now will hurt our job creators and stunt our already fragile economic recovery. Small businesses create seven out of every ten new jobs in Ohio."
As the ball left Stewart's bat on his drive off Brad Lidge, he felt for sure that it was gone. Although Stewart made it safely into third, that momentary hesitation while watching the ball could have proven disastrous if he had been thrown out.
Lessman is one of hundreds of thousands of patients across the country to undergo robotic surgery in recent years.

Beyond the local branches, banks are hiring some people in Northeast Ohio - and having their offices here - because of the talent here. "They don't have to be sitting in Columbus to do their jobs," said Walsh of Huntington.
In truth, if they had their way we'd be back in the late 19th century -- before the federal income tax, antitrust laws, the Pure Food and Drug Act, and the Federal Reserve. A time when robber barons -- railroad, financial and oil titans -- ran the country. A time of wrenching squalor for the many and mind-numbing wealth for the few.

East Coast Original Frozen Custard, 6240 Pearl Road, Parma Heights, 440-842-6577: Hey, is that Fonzi over there, with Richie and Joni? Could be at the best-looking stand in town – a neon drive-through doozy that could have been a "Happy Days" hangout. East Coast serves concretes, cones, shakes, sundaes and malts. But it's the rich creamy custard, with new flavors daily, of which the stand is most proud. For small eaters, they have a nice kiddie cone that anyone can order.

Pandering to the stubbornness of Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats does not sit well with those of us who said "enough is enough" in 2010.

Part of what makes the movie so frustrating in its essential flatness is that there is an interesting idea for a film tucked away in all that, something about the intersection of mental illness and possession, the point where faith must pick up what science can no longer explain. But instead of exploring that, there is lots of tedious exposition with an over-reliance on direct-to-camera confessionals as dutiful setup to a handful of dreadfully handled exorcism scenes. One of the key ad images for the film, an elderly nun whose eyes have no pupils, is seen only in passing and there is a lame attempt to milk a big scare out of a dog barking on the street.

Hallahan won a league-best 19 games in 1931, and his nickname was, of course, "Wild Bill."

Darnell frequently spars with colleagues over meeting decorum. A year ago, she clashed with Eaves after she exceeded her speaking time and he ordered her microphone cut off. Eaves, at the time, was trying to rein in meeting lengths, and Darnell talks the longest during meetings by far.

The building was the Palazzo Mauro de Andre, a sports/multi-purpose arena that, with about 4,000 seats, held close to as many people as the halls in which the CSO had performed in Rome, Naples and Brescia combined. The orchestra’s late summer 2011 European tour had ended in Vienna’s 19th century music temple the Musikverein, known for its “golden sound.” This Russia-Italy jaunt would wind up here?

My work requires that I travel frequently, and Dan has been going out with Harry to gay bars where he gets "hit on" often. I can tell he likes the attention. I should also mention that Dan seems to be considerably less interested in sex lately.
It's little wonder that L.A. voters and ratepayers, most of whom can only dream of getting the gold-plated retirement packages and high salaries that are awarded to DWP workers, resent the City Council's frequent votes to raise utility rates. They were hit again Wednesday when the council approved a 2.9% hike for water rates, and even steeper annual increases are planned for the next three years. Yet for all the justified populist outrage, there's still a genuine need to raise DWP rates. DWP salaries are built into the utility's operating expenses, but the current rate hikes are needed to pay rising capital costs connected with higher prices for water and electricity, meeting federal and state standards for drinking water and switching to renewable power. Failure to approve the rate increases could result in fines costing ratepayers more than the increases.

Staub liked what he saw but suggested tweaking a few things. We decided to use a regular pizza stone as the base of the insert; it's lighter than a base made of firebrick but will still absorb and radiate the heat necessary to set the crust. I then placed two thick firebricks on either side of the pizza stone to act as walls; they would absorb and radiate heat as a pie baked.
Planning for this transferral of wealth didn't just increase the foundation's endowment: It produced hundreds of millions of dollars of charitable donations for use around the state.

When he gets to the M page and finds out it's "M is for Mouse," Moose goes ballistic and rampages through the rest of the book, stomping on the pie on the P page and overturning the queen on the Q page. Finally, Zebra takes pity on him and invites Moose to share his page, as "Z is for Zebra's friend, Moose." There's lots to look at and laugh over in Zelinsky's comic illustrations - including a gag on the cover: Lift the jacket and you'll see the "normal" cover with "Z is for Zebra" before Moose butted in with his own sign. This is hooves down the most fun alphabet book in years.

But while K-pop has a lively Internet presence, America lacks a dominant media hub for first encountering K-pop culture. If one emerges, it might the Culver City-based Mnet. Its cable channel, a division of CJ Entertainment, is heavily focused on K-pop and broadcasts a mix of video countdown shows like "M! Countdown," "Jjang!" (a celebrity gossip show) and "Hello Pop!" (a social-media-themed show whose 21-year-old host, Chrissa Villanueva, is L.A.-raised and Filipina).

But together, we are moving in the right direction. And to the cynical birds in the rafters who would like to dismiss Baltimore's achievements across three mayoral administrations as merely part of a national trend, think again. If you think smarter policing, better drug treatment options, youth interventions and sufficient public funding don't matter, just look at Newark, Trenton or other cities where crime is rising.
And that assumed she would fully retire at some point, but at which point she wasn't certain. She didn't pursue bioethics on a lark; it was a field that allowed her to pick up work as a consultant for three or six months.

Vendors at AT&T Park are not assigned sections. They are free to roam. Lowe doesn't do the upper deck because the aisles are narrow and the stairs steep and one too many times he has had a prankster bark him all the way up to the top row only to cancel the sale. So he leaves that to the younger vendors, meaning everybody else.

Few diseases have been the subject of more books than the HIV/AIDS pandemic, with such notable works as Randy Shilts' 1987 volume "And the Band Played On: People, Politics and the AIDS Epidemic" and Laurie Garrett's 1995 "The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Disease in a World Out of Balance." Not surprisingly, writers have been able to paint a more complete picture of the emergence of this deadly disease as new genetic research and other insights have revealed how the plague began and how it spread. Also not surprising, the tone of these tomes has become gloomier as the difficulties of fighting this scourge have become clearer and the prospects of defeating it seemingly bleaker.

The bad news: You probably aren't among the 5,000 worldwide members of the Academy for Magical Arts. The good news: You can still get into its clubhouse, the Magic Castle (7001 Franklin Ave.). It's a 1908 Victorian mansion a few blocks north of Hollywood Boulevard. Since 1963, the castle has served dinners and brunches to members and guests, who enjoy the magicians who work the castle's intimate rooms — usually nine performers a night in three rooms — flashing cards, reading minds, creating illusions. Though a fire in October closed the club briefly, the adjoining annex soon reopened Wednesdays through Sundays, and management is hoping for a full reopening in January or February. If you don't know a member, you can buy a 30-day membership ($100). Or — attention, please — you can book a room at the neighboring Magic Castle Hotel (7025 Franklin Ave.). In fact, this low-profile, 30-room hotel (a converted apartment building with a central pool) would be a great value even without access to the castle — low rates, pleasant grounds, sky-high TripAdvisor scores. Check in, take a swim, don the tie and jacket or little black dress (the castle has a formal dress code) and catch the hotel's free shuttle to the clubhouse. There you'll step into a world where secret doorways lead to shadowy bars, where Cary Grant and Johnny Carson once were insiders and Neil Patrick Harris sits on the board of directors. When the last trick is done, catch that shuttle again and close out the night with a $12 martini at neighboring Yamashiro (1999 N.

This is just as insulting as the stereotype of all Christians as moralistic, repressed softheads.

Turmeric, also known as Indian saffron and yellow ginger, is also sometimes used to add color to rice dishes that traditionally include saffron, but the two are not related. Their aromas and flavors are very different. However, both are easily overused and can become disagreeable, so add judiciously.

Actually, thanks to some rhetorical double-bookkeeping, Giuliani was able to cram abortion-related issues into his 80% solution. True, he alluded to his own longtime pro-choice position by noting that "people of good conscience come to different conclusions about whether abortions should be legal in some circumstances" (an assertion that is anathema to many Values Voters).

There are, of course, other ways to remove Ohio public officials. One is impeachment, but that moves more slowly than a (pre-global-warming) glacier. Then there's the General Assembly's power to remove judges through a procedure -- perhaps never used -- requiring a two-thirds vote of each legislative house.

Last decade, voters took that route to remove certain school board members in Madison (2005) and Lawrence (2006) counties.

If China won't revalue, the alternative is retaliation. This might start a trade war, because China might respond in kind, perhaps buying fewer Boeings and more Airbuses and substituting Brazilian soybeans for American. One proposal by Reps. Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, and Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, would classify currency manipulation -- which China clearly practices -- as an export subsidy eligible for "countervailing duties" (tariffs offsetting the subsidy). This makes economic sense but might be ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization. A House committee last week approved this approach; the full House could pass it this week. Ideally, congressional action would convince China to negotiate a significant RMB revaluation.

Take Tony Dungy and his years as the coach of the Colts. I did a lot of his games. I got to present him with the Lombardi Trophy when he and Peyton Manning and the Colts won the Super Bowl in 2007. I always learned a lot when I talked to Tony Dungy. He wasn't necessarily the fire-and-brimstone guy, but there was passion and an undercurrent of goodness in what he had to say -- in his comments about other people and players and about what he said as far as their potential. How he tried to tap into that potential and get the best out of individuals. I felt inspired by him.

The creatures themselves — which breed like insects, and grow up to be eyeless, slimy gargoyles — are certainly a change from the usual fiends. Bettany, meanwhile, looks intense — perhaps he’s intently trying to remember when he was in movies such as “A Beautiful Mind” — and Plummer looks like he’s very pleased to have tricked you out of your money.

Denihan was referring to the crippling funding cuts his agency will absorb in coming weeks. In the budget that Gov.

You might start with an investment of $100,000 that would otherwise sit in a bank money-market account.

You can withdraw the cash if you purchase a rider that returns your premium.
Douglas Duerr, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant with U.S. Financial Advisors in Montville, gives this example: “If I buy a computer server for $10,000, I am not allowed to write off the full $10,000 as an expense in 2012,” he said. “I have to capitalize the asset and depreciate it over its `useful life,’ say, five years.

We're unimpressed, to say the least, with Greuel's campaign commercial, in which she takes on a program at the Housing Department and rails against "the city" for its failure to track loans. As for the loans, she has been a member of the council's oversight committee and bears as much responsibility as anyone. As for the department, she would do well to ensure that every city agency is as efficient and effective, and as good at resisting political pressure from council members who would rather the department offer special deals to favored developers than conduct business in an evenhanded, transparent fashion. The department should be her model, not her target.

Even though people ages 50 and older make up a third of the nation's population, the AARP-eligible represent only 21 percent of ticket buyers, according to the Motion Picture Assn. of America. While "The King's Speech" and "The Artist" generated significant revenue from older patrons, very few movies are aimed directly at that audience, particularly in the summer.

At the same time, public school districts must find more efficient ways to operate and bring in new revenue. Vermilion does so by opening its doors to students outside of its district. More districts should offer their own versions of public school choice.

Looking back at the percentage of Americans with jobs in the 1990s (rising) and the 2000s (falling), Princeton University economist Alan Krueger estimates that 70% of today's job shortage is simply cyclical, the result of a disappointing recovery from a deep recession. But he attributes 30% to changes in the job market that began a decade or more ago.

Nearby neighbors Good Luck Dim Sum and Wing Lee Bakery offer a wide variety of dumplings and other dim sum specialties to regular crowds.

It's the same story at Wing Lee, though there's less room to sit down inside, so be prepared to wait in line.

Dan Bejar may be best known for his hand in making thinking-person's power-pop hipster-compatible in New Pornographers. But this is where he goes to get his yacht-rock on. At least that's what he did on last year's excellent "Kaputt." Where earlier Destroyer efforts were closer in spirit to David Bowie's "Hunky Dory" days, "Kaputt" is soft-rock gold, awash in smooth-jazz saxophone and dreamy synth with Bejar out front singing everything exactly how Al Stewart would have sung it if this were the year of the cat.

It seems good enough for her American audience (Mr. Stanley and Don).

There's that process in recording of doing overdubs where you're constantly thinking: "I don't like the way I sound. I'll change this and change that." And the next thing you know, it's not you anymore. It's not as honest as it could be. So we just kind of accidentally nailed it by not going that route.

Ghaleb's food still shines brightly. Spread out on the plate like a purple carpet, the finely minced beet salad ($6.50) is seasoned with lots of black pepper, crunchy bits of fresh parsley, lemon juice and olive oil.

Now consider life with our children. We never get the ones we so looked forward to, either. Those perfect little always-delightful things who respond to us sweetly and love us perfectly into our old age. We get the children who present challenges, and difficulties, and outright sin to be dealt with in ways we never thought possible, but who give us joy and enrich us in ways we never conceived of, either. Not least of all because suddenly it's not "all about me" anymore.
New entertainment program at sea -- Fort Lauderdale-based Silversea Cruises has announced it is launching a revamped entertainment program created exclusively for the company's ships by Choozi Entertainment. In a move away from traditional production shows, the new concert-style concept will feature a cast of classically trained vocalists and musicians performing a celebration of music from Motown to opera to pop and rock. Director and choreographer Christopher Childers and his sister, Suzanne Childers head the star-studded cast. Among the new shows are Signed, Sealed, Delivered, a musical journey through Motown's songbook, High C's, classical music and well-known arias with a fresh twist, and Fabbalicious with the music of ABBA  all three shows presented in the ship's Show Lounge. Among shows in other of the ships' venues is Decades, a tongue-in-cheek look at pop music through the decades, presented on the Pool Deck. The new entertainment offerings have debuted on Silver Cloud; will be rolled out onto the Silver Whisper, Silver Wind and Silver Shadow later this month and will be aboard the Silver Spirit in March.

I thought the a la carte sides ($6) might be another highlight - after all, these local veggies have just come out of the ground. But two of the three I sampled didn't bring anything extra to the meal: The padrone peppers were fiery enough to overwhelm any main dish; and the greens were bitter enough to make your hair curl. Only sweet roasted sunchokes - tubers that look like gnarled ginger - made a happy impression.
"There's is a unique racial aspect to this issue. Young African American males are killed by guns at a higher rate than any other segment of our community. We want to make safer our youth. We want to make our African American youth safer."

If manufacturers get word from a doctor or hospital about a death or injury that occurred as a result of their product, they are legally obligated to investigate the event and report it to the FDA. But the process isn't straightforward, as has become clear in the recent controversy over the malfunctioning St. Jude's Riata defibrillator leads (wires that connect a defibrillator to the heart). The FDA said an individual doctor's report helped alert them to the problem, but it was months before the device was recalled.
Republicans attacked the report as an attempt to grab publicity and defended the process as inclusive and transparent.
But no one has brought forth such a change. So although I admire the honesty of Tvert's amendment and don't think it would greatly expand current usage of marijuana, I am certain it would create a confusing second system for regulating the drug. Is marijuana medicinal or recreational? Understanding that Percocet is used both ways does not make me any more likely to support over-the-counter sales of it at my neighborhood liquor store.

Hey, TR: Can you please tell me what is so difficult to understand the concept of letting faster players play through? Many courses list how long it should take to play and have it posted on the scorecard to let faster players play through but every time I go to play, we inevitably run into a group that is playing agonizingly slow, have two or three holes open in front of them but will not let anyone play through and look at you with daggers for catching up to them or God forbid asking them if you can play through.

So if you're troubled by stuffy ears, muffled sounds or earaches, you may need to help the Marshall clean up the neighborhood. Place a container with a small amount of mineral oil in it, into a bowl or pan of warm water. Never heat the oil in a microwave. Lying on your side with your ear facing the ceiling, drip the oil into your ear using an eyedropper. Then read a book or watch the tube. The wax will dissolve in less than an hour. Tip your head to let the wax drain into a towel. You can also get an earwax removal kit for less than $10 at the corner pharmacy. If these attempts don't work, talk to your doc. You don't want to poke around in there and risk damaging your eardrum. * * *

When you get away with doing something wrong, you might do it again and again, and eventually create a nasty habit of mooching off others or letting someone else do the work while you accept the credit. Now that you have been caught and made accountable, you are in a better position to be a solid citizen and a more responsible and honest contributor to society, not to mention a role model for your future family. See? It works.

Dear Carolyn: Is there a polite way to say to well-meaning family and friends, "Please don't feel like you have to try to set me up with every gay man you know just because I am single"? I live in an area without a huge gay community, so I'm grateful for occasional setups with guys who share my interests; but it feels like sometimes these matchmakers are using "You're both gay" as their only criterion.

But by Aug. 1, when Kevin Mahanay's Lexus sedan made a right turn at that corner without stopping, things weren't all that clear from the camera's angle; a scrawny tree had sprouted enough greenery to obscure the camera's view of some of the traffic light.Yet the device flagged Mahanay for a $100 ticket.
"I started chipping away on meth, just to stay awake during the day," he said. "Around 2000, 2001, I was falling apart" from sleep deprivation, he added, and "the emotional devastation of seeing my best friend going insane."

Yet Cohen, despite his nearly 300,000 Twitter followers, doesn't live the always-on world of social media. Just back from vacation, the New Yorker hasn't followed the Occupy Wall Street protests closely and, at midday Friday, hadn't heard who'd won the Nobel Peace Prize overnight.
“This will enhance the ability to evaluate some of the products we are making right here in real time,” said Pete Rowland, spokesman for Picatinny Arsenal, the Army’s research and development site in Rockaway Township.
Of course, to the manufacturers and marketers who have realized that there's big money in it, men's grooming is no joke. "I think suddenly the people who make women's skin-care products realized they were missing a whole other side of this business by not catering to men," Mr. Spurlock said. Their efforts to convince men that it's cool to use creams, gels and lotions has paid off handsomely—take the success of Axe body spray. Now, traditionally female-oriented brands such as Dove are attempting to cross the gender boundary.
LaTourette said he's always felt a kinship to Garfield, and has a portrait of his family displayed in his Washington office.
Now some Republicans are trying to find a way to squirm out of the defense cuts that are part of the penalty for the supercommittee's failure. President Obama is quite right to promise to veto any such legislation. The Pentagon budget surely needs to be reduced in order to bring down the deficit, but across-the-board cuts aren't the best way to do it. Still, a belief in Washington that there need be no consequences for a failure to act responsibly is what got us in this mess in the first place. The mandatory cuts the nation now faces don't go into effect until 2013, so there is theoretically time to strike a deal before the most damaging effects of the supercommittee's collapse are felt. But that won't happen if Congress votes to remove the noose it placed around its own neck.
"Because it is never going to be enough," said Chadsey, referring to the roughly one-year moratorium Shaner had suggested. "They will always want to do something else. The rules on the books now are strong and they will be enforced.
Konner Ruggles scored back-to-back unassisted goals in the game's first three minutes to stake Howard to a 2-0 lead. After Mikey Wynne finally put Glenelg on the board with 5:15 left in the opening quarter, Nick Striebich quickly answered to put the Lions back up by two.

The hurried tone of early scenes abates with the appearance of Rowe's Diwata. From her first scene when she stages an online podcast entry of her diary, Rowe's Diwata playfully manifests all the eccentric excesses of a first-class drama queen. Although Rowe's boisterous Diwata occasionally pushes the envelope too far, she's lots of fun, and towards the end of the play when a more sensitive side of the character is called for, Rowe comes through.

"It is profoundly gratifying to know that since launching in Denver at the Buell Theatre in April 2002, 'The Lion King' tour has been instrumental in bringing new audiences to the theater across North America for the past 10 years," says Jack Eldon, vice president, domestic, for Disney Theatrical Productions. "We are overwhelmed by the enduring response to the show and are enormously thankful to our audiences for their continued enthusiasm and support. We look forward to sharing this theatrical phenomenon with more cities in the coming years."
The project, after all, depends on a city-run airport surrounded by the county, and money from both the state of Missouri and federal grants. And it's being steered by a board with representatives from the state, three counties and several local business groups.

Even applicants with proper credentials and relevant experience struggle to have their applications considered if they have a record. At JumpStart, the nonprofit pre-apprenticeship construction training program my organization runs in Baltimore City, it's noticeably more difficult to place a qualified graduate in a job if he has a criminal record, compared to graduates with similar backgrounds and experience who have no record.

Much of the legend which surrounds Edward Foster derives from his longevity. His claims of a great age can be traced somewhat earlier than the 1862 article, with his stated ages in the 1851 and 1861 Census records being 90 and 99 respectively. Reports in The York Herald (27 April 1861) and The Hull Packet (3 May 1861) also gave his age as 99 years. Unfortunately, I've as yet been unable to locate him in the 1841 Census.

my husband created a slideshow for my grandfather, which was viewed during his wake. We gave copies on disk to a few people (my aunts and uncles mostly we didn't have time to make very many) and created a drop box file. And then my husband uploaded it onto youtube - and I'm not sure how my grandfather would feel about that. He's the sort that was only in the paper in his wedding announcement, his promotions at work, and his obituary. I'm not sure that he would want to join the "reality show" entertainment craze. But I do think that it will make him chuckle that Edward Mulhare (the actor) and Edward Mulhare my grandfather (two different people) are likely to confuse the heck out of viewers on Youtube.

A friend posted this article on Facebook: it's about how people are much happier when they change their lifestyles to spend less. In a recent study, researchers found that spending money on "experiences" makes people happier, longer, than buying stuff. "‘It’s better to go on a vacation than buy a new couch’ is basically the idea,” according to Professor Elizabeth Dunn (from the University of British Columbia), citing the research done by her colleagues, Leaf Van Boven and Thomas Gilovich. The theory is that vacations and other experiences offer longer-lasting memories than new stuff, which eventually becomes old stuff.

My grandmother was a painter and had many art books which are now at my family home. As I flipped through some books I came across a Picasso poster, neatly folded into fours, that was between the pages.

Magpies will love the use of colourful semi precious stones throughout the collection. Blue agate, amethyst and lapiz lazuli are fashioned into orbs and arrowheads adorning statement necklaces and earrings.
Since Bryan and Jeremy were climbin the Petzl Ridge of the Grand Teton, I tagged along with Matt and Holly but sadly, did not eat any chicken because the line was cray-cray long. Instead, I partook in the baked goods section and procured myself a peanut butter and jelly bar with a Diet Coke. Sassy.

The ultimate is to have a beer cellar/garage where you can age and store a wide selection of beers (the same principle as a wine cellar), but many of us don't have the space.
And then of course, we get to the complexity of the digital world. If I take a digital photograph created by someone and change its format to create a new image of my own, is it the same item still? As a digital image specifically, it can be uniquely defined very accurately as a specific stream of bits. If I change a few, is it still the same? If I take a colour image and make it black and white, is it the same?
I sighed deeply. His words were difficult to swallow and so I borrowed some courage from the bottle of vodka on the table. He’s right. I know he’s right but I also know I’m not the only one to blame.
We break His heart daily and yet He still stands there, with fullness of joy, yet I’m sure an indescribable longing for me to just look at Him. I slam the door in His face. I ignore His phone calls. But when I want something I remember good ‘ol God. It blows my mind that He still listens…because He is patient, He is kind. He doesn’t take into account the wrong suffered to Him.
Last year, Mark Sterling and Jeremy Wyatt delivered the 2011 MWR Match of the year with the first ever 60 minute Iron Man Match during the MWR Years in January of 2011. When the 60 minutes expired and the bell rang, they were tied with no clear cut winner. The fans came to their feet chanting for more. 3XW’s Todd Contryman gave them what they wanted and the match continued. During an explosive 7 minutes of action it would be Mark Sterling who would have his hand raised in victory, thus earning the nickname “The Iron Man”

You have to get it into your system, babe: your expectations on relationships are not necessarily meeting the guy’s expectations. It is very likely to be, that when you think you two are at the stage of ‘telling the world’ about your little romance, he is still thinking whether to see you again.

“One new mom admitted to feeling bored at home all day, since she was used to being surrounded by activity and other adults at her former job. Another described rushing out to the grocery store as soon as her husband got home, just to have an outing and some time to herself. Do not feel ashamed or guilty if you’ve had the same feelings.” — excerpt from Positive Discipline: The First Three Years, by Jane Nelson, Ed.D., Cheryl Erwin, M.A., and Roslyn Duffy.

The question might be raised, not just with respect to this piece but regarding everything else that I say as well: why should commercial cinema operate with the burden of questioning institutions? Why should there be a deeper level to films at all? what difference does it make whether a film is ‘radical’ enough or not?

But, even as the TV networks ran up millions of dollars in expenses covering Monica and Paula, there was next to no attention to Whitehead’s religious-political goals. Those motives might normally have been expected to draw some interest, especially as the possibility grew that the Jones-Lewinsky controversy could lead to some form of impeachment proceedings against President Clinton (which it did later in 1998).

“The Work of Art. When I watch the audience at a concert or the crowd in the picture gallery I ask myself sometimes what exactly is their reaction towards the work of art. It is plain that often they feel deeply, but I do not see that their feeling has any effect, and if it has no effect its value is slender. Art to them is only a recreation or a refuge. It rests them from the work which they consider the justification of their existence or consoles them in their disappointment with reality. It is the glass of beer which the labourer drinks when he pauses in his toil or the peg of gin which the harlot takes to snatch a moment’s oblivion from the pain of life. Art for art’s sake means no more than gin for gin’s sake. The dilettante who cherishes the sterile emotions which he receives from the contemplation of works of art has little reason to rate himself higher than the toper. His is the attitude of the pessimist. Life is a struggle or a weariness and in art he seeks repose or forgetfulness. The pessimist refuses reality, but the artist accepts it. The emotion caused by a work of art has value only if it has an effect on character and so results in action. Whoever is so affected is himself an artist. The artist’s response to the work of art is direct and reasonable, for in him the emotion is translated into ideas which are pertinent to his own purposes, and to him ideas are but another form of action. But I do not mean that it is only painters, poets and musicians who can respond profitably to the work of art; the value of art would be much diminished; among artists I include the practitioners of the most subtle, the most neglected and the most significant of all the arts, the art of life.”
With that burst of open, honest truthfulness, I’m going to take another run at finding my old friend Jed through the internet. If anyone out there happens to know his whereabouts, or the actual source of that wonderful quote, please let me know. I owe whoever said it a debt of gratitude for changing my life (via Jed). My hope is to one day discover a previously unknown philosopher at the other end of that bit of brilliance. But, even if I don’t uncover that deep well of provocative insight, I’ll still continue to make the most of the quote in my everyday life—at least as some incredibly useful free advice!

There has been a lot of preparation for this film with origin stories for four of the main characters or five if you include Loki’s introduction as the villain in Thor so now the film has finally been released it is a great relief that the preparation has really paid off in a film that the delivers the best translation of a comic book into a film so far.
The raw meat smell of the blood wafted past Xu Guan’s nostrils. His stomach rebelled. Xu Guan tried to raise himself up onto his hands and knees but he was too late. Vomit involuntarily lurched past his lips and onto the cool, white tile floor. Splatters sprayed back onto Xu Guan’s face immediately inducing a second round of regurgitation. The small hospital meal, eaten only hours before, liquified and trailed across the floor in the direction of the pool of blood. Xu Guan’s stomach was empty but it continued to lurch as the stench of the mixing pools reached his senses.

This is a 3 song EP that Joel and I recorded at Louder Studios in SF with 2 acoustic guitars and a piano. It is 3 Howlin Rain songs rendered into mutant acoustic versions. We mostly just ran tape and played and sang with a piano overdub or a vocal overdub here or there when we felt we could do better or to round it out. It was a quick little session that we did in one evening in some left over time from a mastering or editing session that was for something else to do with preparation for Magnificent Fiend's release back in late '07. I just came across them and took a listen the other day and they sound raw but beautiful and ghostly to me. More like ghosts than old songs and recordings usually sound to me. I Especially dig the haunted saloon piano vibe and "Romancing The Stone" soundtrack-esque acoustic solo. The proper accompaniment drink for this EP is a tall Vodka with Club Soda and plenty of fresh Lime. AKA the Tim Green fave.

So the Marriott Copley Place was great to stay for its central location. Boston is a great walking town, so nothing is too far out of reach if you are willing to walk a little. However, the nightly rate is not for the budget crowd. For work, it was great, but I probably would never come here on personal travels unless there was a really good deal.

2. How do you fellowship with one another? Are you spending more time away from your wife and talking about your wife to your friends than you are her? Women, are you spending more time at your prayer group talking to them about your husband instead of talking to him? Men, what have you placed as priority in front of your wife? Women, are you children top priority over your husband? Just because you may be a mother doesn’t mean you stop being a wife. God first, Husband & Marriage second, Kids third….so many marriages are destroyed because of the priority of the kids have become first…Let me just ask this question…do you really want your kids to grow up in a broken marriage so they can learn from your example? Is that the priority you want for your children? If your marriage is going to make it you have to fellowship with one another. Jesus own words…where two or more are gathered in my name I am THERE…

“Dick Cavett and Johnny Carson don’t know what to say to anybody black, unless there’s some black bitch on the show and she’s all over them,” he told me while conducting a guided tour of his unconventional but comfortable Upper West Side residence. “It’s so awkward for them, because they know all the white facial expressions, but they’re not hip to black expressions, and God knows they’re not hip to Chinese expressions. You see, they’ve seen all the white expressions, like fear, sex, revenge. White actors imitate other white actors when they express emotions, but they don’t know how black people react. Dick Cavett is quiet now when a black cat is talking to him, because he doesn’t know if the expression on his face means ‘I’m going to kick your ass,’ or if ‘right on’ means he’s going to throw a right hand punch. So,” he continued, pointing out the oddly shaped, multi-level blue tile bathtub, “rather than embarrass them and myself, I just play on those shows and tell them not to say anything to me—I have nothing to say to them anyway.”
Teachers have a different ‘knowledge’ than parental knowledge and it comes into play because unlike any other profession, teachers are given the PRIVILEGE of working with children and often times the parents don’t even know us by name. Teachers have to earn that trust day in and day out – with parents, but more importantly with students. The trust is so explicit that we are often told more than anyone else by students about their life and only when we have proof or a darn strong feeling that the ‘hypothetical’ discussion taking place is real can we report the issue to parents or social services. We can ask all manner of questions, suggest other people the student can talk to, services and phone numbers to contact but we are limited in giving opinions. By law we are mandated reporters and we stress to children that what they tell us falls into this category because we want them to know we care enough to do what is right, no matter what the outcome. Sometimes the most we can do is recommended to the school psychologist, the administrator, etc. that this child have an appointment. We can not even write our concerns in the cumulative file so we share them with another teacher(s) because each child is so precious to us and we don’t want something to happen.
Today was kind of a lazy day. I slept in for the first time in a while which was really nice. I spent some of my day cleaning up my computer, deleting junk and making more space on it. I did some studying and I spent some time cleaning out the kitchen. We are in need of weeding out the entire house and we have both agreed that the kitchen is where we will start and I did that while my husband hauled off brush today.
You know that the BBC website surpasses other news outlets such as the New York Times (although the most viable option if you like your news to be from this country) and the Washington Post. You know that the BBC has the most functional lay out because it is set up like a website and not like a newspaper that is online. You also know that in regards to the three elements that make a good news outlet; multimedia, interactivity, and on-demand, the BBC incorporates all three and does so very well.
As it was, when we finally worked our way up to trotting, as I would squeeze with my legs and push her forward, she would round up and come back to me in a way, as she shoved off and went into a trot. The reins would go slack a bit and I had no contact as we moved off and sped up. That was a little unsettling for me, but as we moved a few strides along, she started to stretch out and down. Then she would stop. No reason, just stopped. It took a while and we finally went around on an egg shaped circle and made it most of the way around before she would stop again. We were making progress though so I couldn't argue or complain.

Chet and Amanda met 3 years ago via the internet. When they met they instantly clicked and have been together every moment since. They enjoy going to see all that Missouri has to offer and they also have a menagerie of pets to keep them entertained. Amanda is a braillist for a living at the local elementary school while Chet works with HUD to provide a housing program for families on disability. Even before they met Chet and Amanda had a heart for missions and adoption. In 1993, and 1994 Amanda went to Hong Kong/China and Jamaica while Chet has been to Peru and Uganda. That said, after becoming foster parents recently, Amanda realized she has a real heart for the orphans of Eastern Europe. So when she came across Reece’s rainbow she was hooked!

Then there was the time my husband came home from a hunting trip and told me about a rather harrowing experience he'd had driving one of the other fellas to the hospital. (The poor guy fell out of a tree stand.) On the way to the hospital, my husband looked out his truck window and saw a wheel roll past. Turned out it was HIS wheel. Needless to say, he got everything fixed, and got the guy to the hospital okay, but what would YOU have said to him under the circumstances? Me? I sang. Uh-huh. I sang, You picked a fine time to leave me, loose wheel ... See? Sick, sick, sick. But not as sick as my penchant for potty humor.
Holy Thursday, one of my favorite liturgies of all time (ever since I went to my first one at least 15 years ago — honestly I can’t calculate tonight how long ago it was when I first went to one, but I know the first time I went was for extra credit in grade school)! Why is Holy Thursday so important and why is it one of my favorite liturgies of all time? Well, tonight I’ll attempt to answer that as well as shed some personal takes on the liturgy.
5-At one time as a teenager I was in 4 different singing groups as a 1st soprano in my church.
Her feminist values were placed in the back burner when she realized that her affair with Roger wasn’t leading to anything serious. Somewhat unwillingly, she took her mother’s advice and married the surgeon, who seemed to be a great catch. Unfortunately, when he returned from his deployment, Joan learned he chose to return to battle. This is where we see Joan’s true essence shine through in one of my favorite scenes by putting her foot down and refusing to be second to his commitment to the armed forces.
Since I was a youngster I've loved monsters and dinosaurs
My trip to the Caribbean was truly amazing and memorable. One of the reasons why it was so memorable was because anything and everything that could happen to me, HAPPENED TO ME, good and bad. All in all the trip was really fun but unfortunately for me and only me, I got a bad case of sunburn/sun poison after the trip to the Caymans. That along with motion sickness did not help. For those that have not experienced this you do not ever want to. I had nausea, blurry vision, and loss of appetite all at once. Luckily I only started to experience these symptoms the last few days of the trip.

You would fix the TRUE root of the problem! NOT just the symptoms! Am I right?
We agree that each staff member will come up with a starter and a main dish to feature on the menu. That’s easy! What is challenging is to select a dish and reject another as each staff member has such a vast array of dishes they want to use.

That’s very bad news for Barack Hussein Obama and very good news for America.
If I'm right, what you're left with is this: an existing group of readers and subscribers who feel the publications have abandoned them (case in point: the ego-fulfilling guest columns from industry figures have gone by the way side, I'm told) -- and another market that is served quite well elsewhere -- because people in media love nothing more than to write about themselves.

Going to church? No, it’s the weekly dinner prepared by semi-retired master chef Chu for his three daughters in this lovely 1994 Taiwanese film by Ang Lee (perhaps better known in the West for directing Sense and Sensibility, written by and starring Emma Thompson). Although the daughters still live at home, their presence is mandated each Sunday at the table, which groans with gorgeous, delicious food made by their dad.
In a word--yes. The fact that you've been promised you'll get your copyright back eventually doesn't change the fact that, while the publishing contract is in force, you no longer own it. This means that the new owner can alter, adapt, license, sell, or do anything else it wants to your work without consultation, compensation, or even credit to you. Because you gave up copyright, even if temporarily, you have no grounds to protest, and no recourse if the use the publisher makes of your work is offensive to you or changes the meaning or the quality of the work.
My daughter recently began a new job. It’s similar to the job she’s held for the last 4.5 years, but it’s different, too. She works retail, and has moved to a feed and ranch store. Similar, but different than the job she’s been doing.

SANTORUM: I’ll be happy to give you the study. Five times the rate it has gone up. Why? Because people are ready to pay a cheaper fine and then be able to sign up to insurance, which are now guaranteed under “Romney-care,” than pay high cost insurance, which is what has happened as a result of “Romney-care.”

Sorry, I gave Kanye a moment to issue his remarks for the new year, now it's time to listen to a man who albeit is less known nowadays, but whom I respect much more...It's interesting to hear his views on exactly why this whole thing is falling apart; the internet, the lack of compensation for artist's, record stores and studios evaporating...everything he states makes sense and it's kinda frightening to think how much further we might fall.

Second, and more importantly, the post seemed to have such a great sense of closure. Like the story had really seen its end. As if I had learned the lesson, and was free to progress into that blissful liberty of guiltlessness and enlightenment and peace that everyone yearns for, and so few actually find. It sounded as if my problems were over. The skeleton from the closet is finally dead and motionless, the monster is not as scary as he seemed, and the lions have been tamed. But of course, life is never that simple. The man in the mirror still lives.

Many people concerned are not sufficiently informed about their disease: Therefore, the fear of suffocation determines their whole life. The most common reasons for an asthmatic attack are allergies, not-allergic stimuli such as smoke or dust, and also physical effort. Right medicine, as well as breathing therapy, and sports help asthmatics to handle the disease. In physiotherapy the patients learn to focus on their body and to control their breathing. Breathing exercises, relaxing techniques, and specific muscle training strengthen the respiratory tract.
And as the credibility of these Ta Ann lobbyists fast fades, more questions are being asked about those other politicians with links to Tasmania Hydro, which is currently chasing contracts in Taib’s deeply controversial and destructive SCORE programme.
There are vast areas of many US cities where an unarmed white man dare not go in peril of his life, there are far fewer, if any, areas where a black man would be at similar risk, yet it is the black man, not the white who the law protects.

The moving snake on the Pyramid is an annual reminder of a conjunction of the zenith sun with the Pleiades over Chichen Itza, but this is an event which will only occur during a 72-year time window, from 1976 to 2048. Right at the centre of this time window is the year 2012, when the Great Cycle ends. On May 20 2012, the zenith passage combines with a solar eclipse, on the Tzolkin day 10 Chichan, which means serpent. The winter solstice end-point will be 4 Ahau in the Tzolkin calendar, meaning Lord/Sun, and 3 Kankin in the Haab calendar, which means ‘snake-day’.
Somebody needs you… Go find them… Activate yourself… You will not succeed in life unless you are connected to people. Success involves people. People who help you to succeed may not always come to you… In fact they rarely do… You must go to them. Successful people are accessible. “You will never possess what you are unwilling to do.” Jesus knew this… He did not set up a throne in the middle of a city and say, “This is the only place that you can reach me.” He went to the marketplace… to the fisherman’s wharf… to the synagogue… to the homes of the people. He went through towns, preaching and healing everywhere (Luke 9:6). He was reachable… Successful people are reachers. Jesus left the comfort of His Father’s house, and walked into the unholy atmosphere of earth and into the lives of hurting people who needed Him. Jesus went where the people were. Have you a dream? It is connected to people… Success begins somewhere… at some moment… with someone.

Mansfield Park
Dr. Bennett somehow remembered to slip off his shoes before stepping into the water. Before he was in up to his knees he grabbed one little body that floated towards him, lifted it up and deposited it onto the bank. The boy shook Dr. Bennett’s hands off with a ‘I was doing very well on my own, thank you’ look and headed straight back into the water. His second attempt met with more appreciation. Mrs. Warmisham pressed one of her muddy and dripping little girls to her silky floral outfit.

If you want something done right, then do it yourself. Get yourself some machines of destruction, for the sake of defense if offense is not your cup of tea. Why? Have you looked at the newspapers recently or for a decade or so? Take a sabbatical from the world of social media, parties, hollywood, tv serieses and glamour and bite into reality. There is no security in your country. You are more llikely to die of unnatural causes at home, on the roads, in Masjids or in public places than naturally dying in bed. The Police might kill you or a speed-freak driver or your servant or a politician or even a businessman or even a student leader. It’s open season on you, because the population has boomed & life expectancy is at its highest, thus you are just another statistic. No one cares, not even the ones you pay with you taxes to protect you! So what do you do? Buy a weapon today or become a dead statistic.
Old-style variety was much like modern-day comedy in that, as the documentary says: “You couldn’t be in Variety and be in elite company. It just wasn’t done. But, if you became a very big star, you could mix with kings and princes.”
Scenes like Joffrey with his name day present from Tyrion are exactly why watching HBO program is not for the faint of heart, and it’s directly responsible for why two of my friends refuse to watch any of their programming. Thankfully, I’m made of sterner stuff although I was glad to be spared the sight of the whore with her head caved in. Again though, if HBO has a failing, it is their insistence on shoving in our faces the less than savoury sides of life.

And then, I got a little drawer organizer, which is really just a serving tray I picked up for a dollar. In this, I have my highlighters, my professional cards to hand out, and also my recess whistle and key for the kiln room. Both things I do not want to lose! Since this project was completed, it has definitely made my life easier and the system is working, which is a good sign!

6) Launch at least one new eBook - When I brought out "Gravity's Pull" earlier this month I knew that it would go nowhere if it was a one-shot deal. I'm intending to launch at least one new eBook every month for the remainder of this year. When it comes time to set 2013 goals, I can evaluate whether this is something I want to keep in my repertoire or not.

There is zero proof that giving kids the message that playing is a punishment for being fat, or that they have to play hard or they will die, will lead to healthier kids, thinner kids, or help develop a lifelong love of movement in kids – not a shred of evidence.

Much as we hate to derail all the tear-jerking cultural outreach that idiot Britons are so inclined to engage in, we must pose a question: what problems exactly do the radical 2% pose us that the moderate 2% are uniquely well-equipped to deal with, but that the remaining 96% of the population are so helpless in the face of? Must we, the 96%, sovereign and only possessors of our island home, cower under the bedsheets whilst the moderate 2% rides out onto the field of battle to defeat the radical 2%? Must we, the shaken but grateful 96%, subsequently prostrate ourselves before our Muslim saviours, weeping tears of gratitude as we stare up into the overpowering radiance of the moderate Muslims who now stand proudly alongside Nelson himself amongst the ranks of the defenders of Albion?

Tea leaves typically go through a series of steps before they are ready to be sold in shops. Leaves are wilted, either under sun or a temperature controlled oven. Then, they are bruised slightly to enable exposure to air and thus, oxidation. After the level of oxidation desired is reached, the leaves go through a process of fixation to stop oxidation. Lastly, it is dried and packed. While this is typical, many teas go through special intermediate processes that give a particular tea its unique characteristics and they vary from tea to tea.
The whole description captures the tone and feel of the novel as well—and that’s what you want to achieve in your query pitches (even if you aren’t writing YA). Also note that it really doesn’t do much plot summarizing about the novel as a whole. It really just spotlights the main conflict (keeping her spy background a secret from the boy she likes).
While it does not discuss a natural habitat, this activity highlights the habitats created for animals at a zoo. Design your own panda habitat exhibit at the Smithsonian National Zoo. This is a creative activity to explore the needs of the pandas to survive in a habitat at a zoo. By choosing the trees, water sources, food sources, and enrichments, you learn the various plants, shelter, and food pandas need to survive and have fun. When your habitat is finished you have the chance to watch the panda enjoy your habitat.
If trust in their male colleagues or allies had eroded, other issues continued to disrupt RG. Race and class proved two of the most difficult to reconcile. Though Riot Grrrls consisted of several ethnicities and races, many women hailed from white, middle class backgrounds. To their credit, fully aware that feminism in 1970s foundered on its inability to address the needs and concerns of working class women and women of color, leaders attempted to broach both subjects at conventions and elsewhere. In general, the efforts failed to truly address the problem. At the first national convention, discussions about race usually collapsed as many white participants resisted being portrayed or described as “oppressors.” “Some of the women of color were angry and getting a very poor response from one or two vocal people in the room,” noted Jessica Miller. (165) Others felt that only so many ramparts could be run by one movement. “We were what we were,” commented May Summer. “We were suburban young girls involved in this predominantly white scene. It wasn’t Riot Grrrl’s responsibility to attract and recruit other people.”
I am generally willing to talk to anyone about adoption – yet there are some that I just can’t because our values and how we view adoption will never ever be compatible in any way. Yet at the same time I believe talking to others in adoption helps expand everyone’s views – as long as you are open to hearing the words.

My amanuensis, who unlike me wears clothes on the street, apart from her striped socks and little cashmere hat, also favors high-waisted jeans (the vegan brand April 77 is stocked at Noir Kennedy, rue du roi de Sicile, in the Marais), and some cute girlfriends of hers swear by dance leotards. Actually, Mary-Laure is known to have worn dance leg-warmers on her arms to keep them toasty.

Later today, we visited V-man’s brother, who needed help in electric stuff. While the men were busy, I could not control myself any longer and went outside. To the neighbors. Who have horses. Magnificent creatures. I absolutely adore this black horse. Her name is Pietje, the daughter informed me. Pietje is a boy’s name.

So as soon as I got through the aquarium I headed up to the Imax alone. The next movie had started and I couldn't get in. So I went to the main gate and found the lost and found desk. I explained that my daughter had lost her camera. They asked for a description and I told them purple. That's all I could remember. The guy reached over like he was headed for some forms and I thought, oh great, I've got to fill out a form! But he reached past it and pulled out a purple camera! WOOHOO!
Oh yah, my shepherd’s pie today had some chili pepper flakes thrown in. Really, I say add whatever you want to the meat. Thyme, tobasco sauce, Worcestshire sauce, yum…I don’t buy horseradish but I hear that’s good too! And mashed potatoes? Add whatever dairy you have in the fridge. Today I used half and half cream, but usually all I have is milk and butter. Someone I know uses cream cheese, others use sour cream…be creative =) Garlic is amazing too.

Throughout my first year of college I was traveling to a fro a lot, I fell asleep on the train journey home numerous times and ended up in Huddersfield! But it was worth it, Saddleworth was a good place to grow up. There wasn’t much to do in the village so the older people in our group put on raves in the quarries, tunnels and valleys, they all DJed at them – Techno and House mainly, I’d always be there, I remember wanting to be the one behind the decks so badly, but they never took me seriously!!
In the last photo, I really couldn’t actually think of a title, so I just entitled it as “State of Oblivion.” The state of oblivion is something when you really couldn’t think of something, or you just forget everything.

This is a rights transfer on a massive scale that makes the Google Book Settlement look benign. By including any out of print book--not just those whose rightsholders can't be located--it goes far beyond the issue of orphan works. By forcing authors to opt out in order to regain control of their work, it turns copyright law on its head. The problem of orphan works urgently needs solution--but not via measures like this.

You would have expected the Victorian parliament to bring in rigorous laws, prohibiting the use of food adulteration - but not a bit of it! On the one side a public outcry led to an anti-adulteration bill being put before the House of Commons in 1857, but it was voted down, as was a similar bill in 1859. Oratory denounced the legislation

Most agree that Clausen’s early commitment was precipitated by the imprisonment and subsequent transportation to Tatooine of Carroll. Though reports are hazy at the moment, insiders have speculated that Carroll was lured into a trap by Sith lord and ICAA President Darth Brand in an alliance of convenience with Notre Dame and the Hutt syndicate. The resulting battle has accounted for at least four dozen Rebel Alliance casualties and an unknown number of USC football team manager deaths.
Fair enough. I have read a little of the wonders of quantum physics and the butterfly effect, and I agree with all that the report says about them, apart from the link to Astrology. “As above, so below”- a beautifully elegant quote, so expressive, and so completely wrongheaded. I love the acronym Great Organising Dynamic, even if I am not sure I agree, and find the expression attractive- even persuasive, had it been about anything else. The report says I belong to God: many Quakers actually put that into practice, but would disagree that God’s Will is expressed in an astrological chart. It states it is up to me: a Jupiter-Sun conjunct (where they appear close together) means optimism and vitality, but I have to realise them in my own life. Here, I begin to see a value in all this. I read good things about myself, feel better because of it, and then am told to go out and make them true.

The theme for this month is more powerful than any so far. Quiet time, being strong, infinite supply and spending time with nature were all themes that prepared me for this month. I am a channel for Divine healing power. No idea what that looks like yet but I’m on a journey and the destination is not yet in sight. I’m just trusting that each step is carrying me in the right direction. I trust my intuition a lot more and I’m doing what feels right. I’m no longer choosing to ignore the stuff that doesn’t feel right. I’m not ignoring the logical part of my thinking, but I’m allowing the intuitive part to manifest itself more. Already I am feeling more balanced and much less out of control.

Woodworth says his private motion is part of an effort to look at the question of how we decide what a human being is. He believes life begins at conception, and M-312 appears to be a jab at the malleable definition of life. Opposition members believe that by allowing Woodworth to bring this private members bill forward, he is opening the back door to pro-life supporters to voice their arguments. They fear the “abortion debate” will be re-opened.

What is time abundance? It is a mindset, like anything else. When we live with confidence and trust that we have more than enough time to fulfill our ultimate purpose, we are living in a time-abundant state. Consider the alternative: time starvation. Most of us live there most of the time.
Obviously, if you had been discussing classical philosophy somewhere else you would expect someone to point out that it was in fact Heraclitus who first made the remark about foreign cheeses and sell-by dates you erroneously accredited to Pythagoras, without the slightest embarrassment and you could have laughed it off, made an apology and moved on. But supermarket checkout queues are not that forgiving, remember the armed siege that broke out in Littlehampton Safeway back in the 1980s when someone with nine items attempted to enter the 6 items or less (sic) queue?

The question on everyone’s mind has to be, why is this in black and white? My theory is that it is meant to be seen as if through a security camera, which, for the most part, you expect to be in black and white.
Later we went to Cafe Europa for dinner. My dad wasn't thrilled with his pasta, but that was probably an ordering fail on his part (lesson--he only likes calamari if it's fried).

If we have to shame craft brewers into this, if we have to make fun of them, if we have to appeal to their sense of tradition and call them out when they ignore it -- that's how this is supposed to work! The brewers, the passionate ones, are supposed to be running this, not the marketers and sellers of the stuff, and it's supposed to be run for us, the people who love the beer, the people who know when the hell summer and fall begin.

They lay across the benches, and pass out in the stairwells, bref, lounging & smellin' up the joint is where it's at. I'm not completely heartless, but after you've seen hundreds a year the phenomenon becomes less shocking. I don't even get freaked out anymore when they mutter insults at me. (I always have to resist the urge to talk back to the shoe-less man with food stuck in his beard calling me unkempt. Really sir? My hygiene is not up to snuff? I'll run home & jump in the shower for you, but first let me pick that hunk of sandwich from your facial hair.) I was starting to feel pretty proud about mastering the art of ignoring, a true sign of my French integration.
Hipsters are intriguing as a cultural study, but another sect of culture that I don’t fully comprehend. Hipsters are usually on the wealthier side of the spectrum, but they usually dress like they’re poor. Hipsters love fake horn-rimmed glasses, hats, scarves, tiny tight sweaters, layers of poor people clothing, scruff, giant bags, flannel, deep v-necks, and general homelessness-type attire that costs more than my rent. They usually segregate themselves to a certain part of town that is more “artsy” by their standards and can be conquered by their single-speed bikes (Silverlake, Los Feliz, Williamsburg, Greenwich, Wicker Park, The Design District, the entitre Northwest), filled with coffee shops and, of course, Parliament cigarettes and PBR. In my personal theory, that is mostly what they consume aside from some vegan options, thus keeping their skinny and non-muscular figures in tact. Unfortunately, they listen to most of the same music as I do, but this just means they have pretty excellent music taste. I tend to bump into these types at concerts. They flock to vintage stores, tight jeans (women’s jeans, tapered jeans, and skinnies especially), dark hair, side-swept bangs, and serious faces. Walk into American Apparel to find your inner hipster today. The tighter the better, and you might as well pick up smoking and a mustache while you’re at it.
We made a stop at our new local book store on Friday because it had been a very long time since anyone had gotten a new book. We use to go to Borders all the time. We were so sad when Borders closed, but BAM opened up not to long after, so we were happy that we had a book store again.
Matthew is just over 3 months now and time is flying - I hate it. I truly do. I can tell already that he's going to be a handful .. the second he can scoot around the floor he's going to do it. The second he figures out how to talk, he's never going to stop.
Omigbodun shows us that there is still hope. Believe me, Omigbodun has really tried her best in bringing out cogent issues that are affecting Nigeria as a nation.
One of the cooler things we got to do while we were there was go do some tie-dye with the kids. Part of what I loved is that every parent in our camp had bought a pack of plain white t-shirts for their kids to dye, and every family brought all the t-shirts just in case another family forgot to bring some. I love how we take care of each other!

Life's rhythms go on. Most of the things that I considered important when I was 18 just aren't anymore. In fact, even five years ago, I was a totally different person. I remember how my 80-year-old grandmother used to laugh at things that I would say, responding "darlin', none of that grows a garden".
We have been married almost 6 years. I can say it has not been the easiest 6 years. I hope that it gets better as we continue on this journey. You already know some of what she dealt with a couple of months after we said "I DO". You never think that the "for worse" part would even come up that quick but it did.
But even better, the food. I am an Italian girl, and carbs are one of my many best friends. Years of pasta dinners have left me with these thunder thighs and booty to cushion myself as I sit on those hard metal chairs outside of the cafe.
"Jesus, I thank you for little daily crosses, for opposition to my endeavors, for the hardships of communal life, for the misinterpretation of my intentions, for humiliations at the hands of others, for the harsh way in which we are treated, for false suspicions, for poor health and loss of strength, for self-denial, for dying to myself, for lack of recognition in everything, for the upsetting of all my plans....
But Elizabeth has driven the route so many times, she is expert! She knew just where the last stop on the Thruway is where you can load up on Tim Horton's coffee! She also knows how to fill all the cup holders so with many, many cups so that once home, you can still enjoy the coffee for a few days! Excellent!
Naming stuff: Yes, there's no doubt "Figure8" might remind people of a mic or Elliott Smith's last album title. But really, we've been just walking like an 8 in the streets we pass by every day, and with that we've infinitely drawn the figure 8.
I’m glad we had the pre-opening party to kind of work the kinks out because during the middle of the party BOTH bathrooms broke. The men’s had water coming up from the base of the toilet…. YUCK and the women’s just had the water to the rim threatening to overflow but it never did. I called and emailed the building maintenance manager but of course didn’t hear back so we had to shut down the bathrooms! AND this was all happening while one of the ladies from the county offices was here eating so it was super embarrassing and scary!
But our interactions were seldom. I did not seek him out, and he wasn’t in my class anyway – apart from one or two subjects in the senior cycle. He was sickly and missed an awful lot of school. I’m sure he was subject to a lot more intensive bullying and brutality, particularly on the way home from school, but we had different routes home so I didn’t witness anything. To be honest, he just didn’t figure on my radar screen most of the time. I had other, more interesting, more important interests and concerns.
Gale @ That Artist Woman used Elmers galatic glue. I couldn't find it or her other recommendation: Elmers washable school gel glue at Walmart. (I wasn't about to make a special trip.) What I did find was Clear Gel Tacky Glue. I think what's important is that the glue is not for fabric and is in gel form. I tried using good ol' school glue, but it spreads once it's on the fabric, so stick with gel glues.
18st 9lbs (261lbs) the scales said when I stepped on them. I almost cried. My heart sank and I felt sick. That couldn’t be right. I’m officially at my highest ever. The new meds the doctor has put me on, has ‘helped’ me gain a whopping 16lbs in the last couple of months. My head spun. I was pissed!
Oh yes… indeed. It is wealthy beyond imagination. But not because it holds dollars. Again, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report shows that government holds many trillions of dollars worth of everything but dollars – real estate, stock investments, all foreign currencies, banks, General Motors, and many many government owned corporations both national and international. One pension fund alone held over $1 billion dollars in just Chevron Corporation stock at market value, and there are thousands and thousands of these funds! The Social Security Fund is sitting at over 2.5 trillion dollars in investments.
We planted tomatoes, radishes, a couple peppers, tomatillos, okra, watermelon, lettuce, green beans, cucumbers, spinach, basil, oregano, thyme, chamomille, lavender...I think that's all. We put in seven of these things! I did reserve one for zinnias so that I could have cut flowers all summer.
And I got to take their pictures... and we all lived Happily Ever After.
And when naive clients tell me they want to do some of that "social media stuff, you know like Twitter and Facebook" -- for which they will assign responsibility to the lowest ranking person in their organization -- I have to leave the room.

Grilled salted ox tongue with cauliflower cheese croquette, bread and butter pickles is first off. I can't say I've had Tongue in the last 20 years (snigger) but this was an excellent reintroducton. What I expected could be chewy was delicate and light. A great start which set me up for the main course. Shoulder of Roe deer follows, served with sauerkraut, mash and greens. For two on a wooden platter, my eyes widen as it is placed between English and myself. The bone slips away effortless as we dish up generous hunks and even more generous dollops of mash and sauerkraut. It's a bold, hearty dish which is what Supper Club is all about. It is faultless. I am at risk of drowning my keyboard as my mouth waters just thinking about this! Rounding off the meal I am torn between the English cheeses with toasted Bara Brith or the baked custard with Grasmere gingerbread. I'm told the Bara Brith and gingerbread are both made on the premises and on the basis that no one makes Bara Brith like Nan did I go for the custard. The top cracks satisfyingly but I could have probably done without the accompanying sorbet. The gingerbread is good but lacks the dustiness and snap I was expecting. That said it's a good end to a great meal. Where the country comes to town is the phrase that came to mind when I was trying to sum up the Harwood Arms and it's menu. They beat me to it I see as it's emblazoned on their website. Just when you thought you'd had an original thought!

It was a fun place to go for my once-or-twice-a-year haircut, because they would always tease me about the amount to be removed (most of the other male customers being in for short conservative cuts to their lightly oiled black hair), and because it felt like a piece of reality in a way that the Family Salons in Malls never quite did.

(For the theologically conversant - I do realize that "natural law" is commonly used to describe the uniformity of nature, but I am critiquing the practical atheism that often accompanies such ideas, since the Bible clearly teaches that "natural" causes are in fact Divine causes. The uniformity we observe is merely the "regular" consistency of God, while other "miraculous" events should be subtitled under the same consistency, though a broader definition of consistency and a humble, teachable spirit is required to appreciate it. There is nothing inconsistent about Jesus turning water to wine or healing someone of a grave disease, given that He was God Incarnate, maker and sustainer of "natural" laws.)

I did, however, get pretty frustrated with the resistance around here. Let me just confirm that this was not about meat or no meat, or vegetables vs no vegetables. This has never been an issue, and I am proud to say that my children eat almost anything. No, this issue was solely about breakfast (paleo breakfasts can consist of things that especially my daughter will not touch for breakfast) and snacks. After all, the world is full of sugary, floury deliciousness. And well, yes, it's great that mom is feeling so much better these days. Hooray for her. But please, leave us kids alone with this paleo stuff.

Hindon traveled inland to the Transvaal Republic where he became a stonemason and later a police officer. He assisted the Boers against Leander Starr Jameson who, under orders from Cecil John Rhodes, tried to take the Transvaal Republic and its gold deposits by force. Hindon was rewarded for his loyalty to the Boer government with citizenship.
Before I share my reasons, I want to first make it very clear that I have many good friends and acquaintances who have chosen to go this route. And I truly wish them all the best. I hope they become wildly successful and their books get a gazillion fans, because the more good books we have, the more readers are looking for good books to read. And that's fantastic news for every book lover and author out there. Yes, there will be some good Indie titles, some that could have used some more editing, some that make people who like the written word go all twitchy, and some that will blow traditional books away. It's called a bell curve and it's apparent in just about every group of anything in life (yes, I took statistics in college).
My hat will go off to the person who can correctly answer all 30, but I’m not quite sure if any of my guests will be able to pull that off.
January 9, 2009 Clip No. 1979
We headed to the family bathroom at Target where I surveyed the damage. Luckily I had a pull-up, diaper and wipes in the basket of the stroller (I had accidentally left the diaper bag in the car). I'll spare you the details of that delightful 15 minutes spent in the removal of poop from Jackson's posterior (and legs, and shoes-- getting off soiled underwear isn't a tidy proposition). I admit I just threw the underwear in the garbage and didn't even feel guilty. After I got Addy's diaper changed and I had my fill of poop to last me for the next century, we grabbed some snacks and a couple of slurpees and headed off in the stroller again. (I had actually been to Target enough in the past few days that I didn't have anything left to buy. Now THAT is scary.)

Main characters Mike and Donna were easy to relate to, though I often wished more was said in the earlier stages of their professional relationship. Sullivan makes up for this little lapse as the story goes on, with both Mike and Donna showing their true intelligence in their confrontations with the Triple E CEO. Mike and Donna’s relationship unfolds similar to those formed out of stressful, life or death situations, but the main emphasis of the story is not eclipsed by their relationship. Other characters, including the main antagonist, were portrayed with a certain realism that is easily identified with, and that can already be seen with the questionable ethical/moral practices we see from big business present day.
The other day I hit an all time low when after setting the alarm and herding the kids to the car I get myself almost buckled in when I realized I wasn't wearing a shirt! Really?? Now, I was going to the gym so arriving in only a sports bra would not have been a completely inappropriate but it is the closest I have come to being issued a declaration of insanity.
Thanks for sending along Susan Beth Pfeffer's novel, The Year Without Michael. It's a wonderful book on an important topic. Her style--- that staccato prose and crackling dialogue--- is mesmerizing. I read it in one sitting. Pfeffer breaks your heart but she somehow manages to put it together again although the edges remain jagged. A beautiful job.
"Right now we know nothing about (the missing woman). The victim gave us a description and we are conducting the search accordingly. We don't know much about the two assailants either."
For the first time, Dwight described their audience in the language of partisanship. Previously, he had maintained that music lovers existed on a continuum of appreciation, based on education and prior experience, but always with the capacity for growth and further refinement. At this crucial moment, however, he recognized that alliances, whether voluntary or character-based, were being drawn. He hoped the next few months would “show that the ‘appreciating few’ fond of good music for music’s sake are not by any means so very few as it has been tauntingly and often said.” Dwight’s pessimism is epitomized by the fact that he dubbed those who appreciated “music for music’s sake” members of “the rival party.”
On second thoughts, can Stephen Harper really be a bigot, when he allows himself to be photographed shaking hands with a black man?

We had a group meeting this afternoon and I sat there pretty darn anxious. First time doing big group meetings like that out of the hospital. Sometimes even the group meetings in the hospital got my nerves up! Sitting there in a room with a large amount of people, about 50, staff and patients. Today, we went around in a circle and said whether we were at work today or not. I was. Not sure what the point of that is. I guess it’s so that the workplace don’t have to get involved in communicating with the rehabilitation program staff and just hear it from the horses mouth, as they say. It’s not like they even ask though why the person wasn’t at work if they say they weren’t. So I could just not go and say ‘I wasn’t’ and that it’s it!? I’m too good a girl to do that anyway, as much as it sucks that I have to get up now at 6.50-7am, 30 minutes earlier than I had to get up in the hospital.

The Afrikaners only wanted peace, which was offered multiple times to the blacks. After being met with ever more terrorism, Afrikaners diesngaged from 20 areas that were designated as black homelands. Each of these territories was offered full independence; four of them took it — Transkei, Venda, Bophuthatswana, and Ciskei. But instead of focusing on building their nations, the blacks continued to resort to terror.
Ok so yesterday's post was lame. There are a few things I want to write about but can't for fear of hurt feelings. I'll just try to write about something else.
Program 1--11:00am VITAPHONE VAUDEVILLE (1926-30)
I asked former Supervisor Chris Daly, above left, if they were occupying City Hall overnight, and he said, "No, it didn't make much sense since there was nobody at all in the building, and the only people we were bothering was the bride who was roaming around."
Having been expelled, I wrote to Head Office requesting an appeal hearing, which I was entitled to. At least I would then have had the chance to put my case. But even this was denied to me. In fact the reason that I was given for my expulsion was that having resigned the whip I had in effect resigned from the Party, which is utter nonsense. But it seems that they were determined to get rid of me once and for all, come what may.

Order, and left Brendan behind too. He (and his family) had decided – largely because of his sickly nature, it was said (though I believe that the worries of his parents concerning his ability to live an autonomous life as a student away from home also played a large role) – that he would study by correspondence at the British Open University. I was sure I’d seen the last of him and forgot him pretty quickly.

Let me tell you about your new sisters and brothers. The twelve Faverolles eggs came as promised as did a hatchery selection of twelve bantams: 6 Quail Belgian Bearded D’Anvers, 2 Porcelain Belgian Bearded D’Uccles, 2 Golden Sebrights, and 2 Silver Sebrights. I admit I had a momentary twang of disappointment. These were not the breeds I was hoping for! Where were the Silkies with their funny feather poofs? The Barnvelders with eggs the color of dark chocolate? Why did I have to get these birds out of all the possible breeds that the hatchery carried? Mommy was sad because she had read that the pretty Sebrights can be standoffish and flighty; Quail D’Anvers sweet, but plain. Does this mean I’m a bad mommy? Then I thought that perhaps this was a cosmic lesson in acceptance and love. I pushed that disappointment away and made a promise: I am your mommy and I will love you no matter what.

Mr Wuzster (Denny) is also off to the vet tomorrow - he has an ear infection in one ear, not that you would know to see him him running, jumping and playing. Mom noticed he seems to the want the one ear scratching all the time which made her looks and there is a gooey buildup in it. He is also on a de-stuffing roll today, so far we now have a de-stuffed moo cow and my favorite bunny!!!

Sensationalism in the tabloid press is not uncommon and it appears that provocative headlines and large pictures have been a part of the press for over one hundred years. However, there is a change between the reputation of these publications. Hearst’s publications seemed to providing a new frontier in popular culture, integrating personal interest stories with opinion and sensationalism, whereas tabloid publications of today are accused of “dumbing down” news and focusing on scare mongering and moral panic. While I would agree that the articles and headlines of the tabloid publications are still printed to appeal to a particular readership, there is definitely a change in the way these publications are received.
When it comes to the story and the book, we really put our best into writing it, so there is probably not anything we would change in that regard. The one thing we would have changed is we would have found the time to write it four years ago when we had the idea before angels were even popular.
We came up on one little stop about 80 to 100 miles from the town where we knew we'd need to get gas. Terry glanced down at our gauge and decided we were fine, and we kept driving. Unfortunately, the needle dropped more quickly than we were used to, seeing as how we were driving faster than normal. Thirty miles from the town, the "Low Fuel" light came on. Thirty miles is cutting it close. You will understand that the next half hour was spent in quiet solitude and gut-wrenching worry.
The two other layers are the ones that rank a bit higher in the mix. More importance seems to be placed on the second layer that plays like an ambient siren. It contains an unforgiving stereo delay that’s lightly distorted and is the predominant signal of the track we’re about to unfold upon.
We timed it just right on a Sunday afternoon so we did not have to pay admission. This museum is really well organized and takes you through the life and various styles of Picasso. My favorite part of the museum was the rooms dedicated to Picasso’s study of Las Meninas. He obsessed over the original picture by Velazquez and reinterpreted the image into his signature style.
It is too painful I cannot bear it.
It made me start to think about american politics, and how unhappy many Americans are at the moment with our government. When I think about Obama, I really don’t think he’s a bad guy. He clearly loves this country and ran for president hoping to do some good for it. I do feel he has done some good, but if you were to listen to his detractors you would think he has done nothing. The fact of the matter is, there has only been so much he could do, as his party didn’t have majority lead over the house and senate and like all things, change takes time to happen.
Although quite stressful at times, I'm having a lot of fun. I wake up every morning and look up to the stunning green alps that technically belong to Austria. I'm living in a village of about 50 people called Baad in the Kleinwasertal, which is a funny area in that it's a part of Austria but only accessible from the Germany side due to the towering Alps blocking any sort of road. I'm leaning German slowly and understand more than I speak, but it can be frustrating being the only teacher/instructor there that only speaks English. My Vietnamese has not helped me one bit.

While the source material for this film is the stuff of low-grade pulp novels, Orson Welles elevates it using his normal gift for composition and a few directorial flares. These include some choice closeups, a ridiculous court room scene, and the brilliant and famous mirror sequence at the end of the film. I confess though, that I am still struggling with Welles’ awful Irish accent.

Good evening! Yesterday afternoon was very wild and windy - a perfect excuse to spend some time indoors making Christmas cards! It always takes far longer than I realise to make batches of cards, which is one of the reasons I have failed to prepare adequately for both of the Christmasses that my Etsy and Folksy shops have been open (there's no point linking to them, they're empty for the third Christmas in a row ;-)). To be ready for when everyone else starts to feel festive, I need to have started my Christmas crafts in August, but that's still camping and cider-in-the-garden time, not crochet and tinsel time!
I was away for a few days last week because of university. I’m currently working on my dissertation, so things are really starting to get busy! I really missed posting, so I’m making sure to keep this blog up to date as I go. Writing poetry is an extremely relaxing and enjoyable process for me, and as a general rule, I try to write each day. I’d post every single day if I thought I wouldn’t bombard you, but I’ll do my best to refrain from overloading you all!

I can make it simpler: the Republicans in the Legislature are lining up to give the PLCB bureaucrats everything they asked for to stave off privatization. Why? Cui bono might be a better question. Who got to these guys? Why are they not listening to the voters and citizens of Pennsylvania, who have been consistently polling at over 2/3 in favor of flat-out privatization?
"I have spent the last several weeks speaking at conferences. I constantly meet moms who are trying to homeschool the best way and be sure that their children get it “all”. How blessed your children are to have you as their moms. However, I want to encourage each of you to relax. Homes have been the place where genius has been birthed, leaders have been made for thousands of years. It was because of the faithful mothers who have trained their children in character, given them chores to do, had discussions over the dinner meal, and read the Bible to their children. I feel so strongly that parents are so intent on getting the “best” experience in education, while not understanding that the most important aspect in a child's education is the mentoring and directing of the parents over the personality, influences, peer relationships, and character development.

In March 2011, I was lucky to be among a group of ~30 people who convened in Racine WI to discuss a national agenda for supporting families with a member with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Why? The role of the family is central to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities across the lifespan. More so than ever before, the family provides medical, behavioral, financial, and other daily supports — these roles are vital and often policy and practises do not recognize them, support them, fund them, etc. As families become the singular central support unit, policy has to emerge to recognize the validity of their position and families have to become equal partners to the policy dialogue.

I recently wrote a piece for the website of the Chicago Sun-Times, discussing both my history of ME and my reactions to the new documentary Voices from the Shadows. For anyone who wishes to understand the agony ME can inflict, and the dangerous ignorance endured by many who have it, the film is a must-see. One of the ME sufferers it profiles is Sophia Mirza, the first person in Britain whose death was officially listed as being caused by chronic fatigue syndrome. Another is my late friend, Lynn Gilderdale, whose mother assisted in her suicide after Lynn's condition became unendurable.

This is why I said this black glitter was no good! I wore the yellow franken the day after I made it, but look, it's no longer yellow! Because the glitter was still losing color, it changed the color of the polish. I made a fresh one and wore it the next day. You'll see that mixture in the next post.

First of all...EW. The water in that pipe was STANK. The inside of the pipe was coated with gray sludge. After dumping that water out - and yes, I did, I dumped it back into the sink without the pipe under it - and cleaning that up, and then going to the OTHER sink to clean the pipe out, I realized that it was not in the bendy part. Sigh.
They drive up towards Eden valley, into the upper Barossa and then turn right and head back south. There, E@L sees some more of those fields of long (not that long) grasses passing up the slopes of low rising hills. These paddocks are demarcated with lines of evergreen trees, is it oak (E@L is not a treeologist, not a character in Murray Bail's Eucalyptus), used along the fence lines as wind breaks. The lines of these trees going up the hill and over the other side have from this angle, a curve, like a side-resting woman's thigh, up over her hip; it really is entrancing, particularly if you are already feeling horny and drowsy.
'Daemon' is Greek and Classical too, of course, but hasn't been used by centuries of poets in the same way. Its link to the modern 'demon' suggests some of the bloody-mindedness often demonstrated by daemons; and it also makes me think of witches' familiars and shamans' spirit-helpers. Though I in no way aspire to be a witch or a shaman, their more down-to-earth, farmyard associations, with their cures for sore-throats and curses on annoying neighbours, suit me and my daemon better. My daemon does not haunt Elysian Fields – though it may perhaps be found grubbing through the great junk-yard of lost and broken things that, according to the fairy-tale, the Four Winds have blown to the Ends of the Earth and there gathered in a heap.

Nowhere in this book does it say this, but if we are to honor, love, obey, respect and etc our husbands and we fail to do so, what does that say about out walk with God. Are we really obeying Him? I honestly thought everything was ok with how I am in my marriage. God showed me that was a lie from the devil trying to deceive me into thinking that. First I preach at my husband and NEVER are we supposed to do that. Second, I let him know his ideas aren't the best (not in a loving way). This is uncalled for! Next, I as his wife am to follow his leadership, not be the leader or try to, which I was guilty of.

In addition to the lower sodium content, they've added whole grain pasta to many soups and they've reformulated several Pepperidge Farm items as well. You can now get whole grain goldfish without artificial colors and flavors too, for example. I was impressed with the variety of healthier options offered.

Singin’ in the Rain is set in the 1920′s, during the transition to sound in film. The “talkies,” among many changes, brought about a new perception of who was considered a good film actor. SITR portrays three film industry characters – a successful silent movie star (played by Gene Kelly, Cover Girl, 1944; The Three Musketeers, 1948); a young, naive up-and-comer (Debbie Reynolds – a schmillion musicals, How the West Was Won, 1962 and mother of Carrie Fisher) and Donald O’Connor’s (That’s Entertainment, 1972; Toys, 1992) piano-playing, prat-falling genius of a side man. This is hilarious comedy – physical, spoken, sung and danced, as well as a somewhat historical perspective on Hollywood. I don’t mind the musical numbers as much in SITR because they don’t stop the story. The lyrics to many of the songs are funny. All the songs are accompanied by dance numbers that are amazing feats of super human athleticism and grace by Kelly, O’Connor, and one terrifically stylized number with classically-trained dancer Cyd Charisse (Brigadoon, 1954 and Silk Stockings with Fred Astaire, 1957).

And finally, two lipmarkers because they seem to have revolutionised the beauty world! The first one was given to me by a friend - and then left in a hotel bathroom in Jamaica. So i had to get myself a new one, which is AMAZING. The shade I got is "Berry" and after applying 2 coats, your lips will turn into a very vibrant red, perfect for winter evenings. The second is Maybelline's Color Sensational Lipmarker in "Shy Red", definitely not as potent as "Berry" so perfect if you're aiming for a naturally-red look!

I love being an educator.
Roses also used as a simple token of affection and love of a man to a women so it's is very useful in a man courting a woman who wanted to win the heart of the woman...I remember my hubby always gave me a bunch of white roses and he succeeded...maybe because he gave me white roses he told me that is a symbol of pure intentions of love and I believed in him until now.

I loved the spontaneity of our friendship and the freedom I felt with him. We were playmates in the truest sense of the word. I spent many wonderful days with him, lying in fields of clover, wandering through the botanical gardens and out to the long wooden pier where we saw cattails and osprey and alligators sliding into the water.

Now, I am fully aware that living on an island is not like vacationing on an island but when Cristina spoke the words, “You know we are hiring…” I had to work to resist the urge to test her sincerity. Sure, I do not speak Spanish, but I cannot think of a better way to learn! But sadly there is no Bikram yoga on Cozumel and its absence would have soon been felt. Even so, if it were not for my commitment to my job, a lease and a cat I may well have stayed a wee bit longer.
The struggle for existence is now revealed as fundamentally a struggle for physical energy, and the conquest of nature has made available supplies vastly exceeding what can be extracted from the unwilling bodies of draught cattle and slaves. It is not the struggle but the energy that is essential to human life. The doctrine of existence for struggle, on the other hand, is the oldest religion in the world.

I had a hard time waking up this morning on only 6 hours of sleep, but still managed to stick to my plan. I made a protein smoothie for breakfast, made out of protein powder, bananas and chocolate almond milk. I also packed two of yesterdays meals and a yogurt and granola bar for snacking.
After the pageant, Hae Sung went to the hospital to check on Ri-An. Since Yoo Jin was still there, both had a chance to talk. Yoo Jin tried to convince Hae Sung to come back but she strongly said she won’t. I believe that Hae Sung expresses herself more with Yoo Jin. She can honestly tell him what she feels and Yoo Jin knows how to accept and understand that. He won’t force her to do something she doesn’t want. I like that. These two may have few scenes together, but they always talk about the things that matter.
I offered to do the food for one particular party a friend was hosting. Mulling over the logistics of containing and moving food for 25 I decided to make a giant chilli con carne, (the premise being- rice/mince/ lutenitza style sauce- are all more than popular.) Thinking ahead, I even made two, one hot and one not. Smugly I expected a runaway success on my hands. As I set it on the table in a ‘taddah!’ moment of glory, the more traditional Bulgarians at the party recoiled in unconcealed horror and proceed to help themselves to more salad in disgust. I think they may still be whispering about the disastrous incident in the village cafe, even today.
Simply put, they are bloody stupid, and they rule us. Furthermore Zoooooma says they will rule us until the second coming. I believe him.

This past weekend we took the cupcake trailer out to Texas Ranch Life for the Washington On The Brazos Event, "The Sundown Social." This was WOB first annual fund-raising event and we had a great time working along side some amazing food vendors. Veritas Bistro from College Station was there with their award-winning food truck. Chef Tai prepared some amazing dishes that we were lucky enough to snag a few samples of. Check out his website and rent his food truck for your next party!

Nothing ever stands still.
It's not as if people reading the book won't have come across the word. Nigger, before. They just won't get a chance to see it used in context, from a certain time period, and associate it with how people thought then, how people think now, the weight of words and terms etc. There will be no chance to grow for people reading this shame-marked book.
Lilly is the real star of the movie and Anjelica Huston is brilliant presenting a natural predator, who doesn't even realize her nature. She's like a shark, in that she doesn't ponder her actions but has to keep moving or drown. She has been a grifter her whole life, and working for Bobo has found a golden opportunity with access to easy money, and regular employment while she continues to steal money. Bobo even expects her to steal as she shows when she recites his speech back to him "If he's not stealing a little, he's stealing a lot." Of course the difference between a little and a lot is ambiguous, especially over time. Much relies on the appearance of order, and when Bobo is tipped off, he has no choice to take action even though her actions could well have been well within what was expected of her. That's the hazard of having a "boss." although the premise of working for someone would seem to be part of her grift. The fact that Lilly would work her grift on someone as dangerous as Bobo shows her dedication to the lifestyle. Her quick turnaround of Myra's murder attempt shows that she's the ultimate opportunist, quick witted enough to try and salvage any situation. Her strong dislike for Myra, aside from objections "anyone would have." concerning her son, are likely based on an instant recognition. They recognize each other as full time and dedicated operators, and instinctual competition.
As we mentioned on the previous page, one criminal drawback is the lack of internal storage. For this, Sony really needs to take a long, hard look at itself because it’s really not a very clever move. Talk about a put-off.
The following day she did get up when I came to feed her, clearly having decided that it was a little too boring to spend all day at the stable. She tasted her food and looked out the window, drank from the water and tasted her food again. It took her at least an hour to finish up her meal. She was not in a hurry. I got her out as the last thing I did before I ran to catch my bus.
'Which one?'
"He was found passed out in his apartment," I told her. "Apparently he'd been out for a while. Does it say what caused him to lose consciousness in the first place?"
It’s just that simple.
I think there is a couple of ways to look at guys stepping up their game. Either be inspired by it or give up. I have always chosen to be inspired.
The biscuits on the table on Sunday were Marion Cunningham’s, of course, because that’s how I’m doing things this year. This woman is teaching me so much! Like that cream biscuits are virtually impossible to mess up. Impossible! Even if you, like me, become convinced that you messed up the recipe and want to throw away the dough without even baking it and your husband and house guests have to talk you down by promising to eat said biscuits, no matter how bad they are. Which they aren’t. They’re outstanding.
‘“Tell the Doctor”, ok, I get it,’ he said to the screen. ‘Go-chill-take-a-pill, I’m on it.’ Ollie started to rehearse the message ‘dead banana’ and turned away from the screen just in time to see his mother and the Doctor consulting a battered old book. It looked like the one he’d seen on her dresser once, and she’d locked it away after that.

The café has nothing to do with the Lomprayah company, but they have an arrangement – useful for both of them, and convenient for the traveller who arriving in the early morning can find a place to squat and maybe have coffee and breakfast.

The popcorn! Okay, movie popcorn tends to be pretty yuck-o, unless you love the taste of stale. Also, they sell it for about eighty bucks an ounce. Also, the Carmike movie theater in Apple Valley has a special: if you buy the bucket of popcorn, anytime the rest of the year you can bring the bucket back and they'll fill it for free. "You don't even need to be here to see a movie," the concession clerk explained. So, what, it's like lunch? You could bring your bucket to the lobby and eat popcorn for the rest of the day? Could you get a sandwich with that, or just M&Ms? Would you bring your friends to the movie theater and treat them to popcorn while not seeing a movie? What...what is the selling point, here? Why is this something I'd want in my life? But Cathie was intrigued, so into the theater we went, bucket o'popcorn in tow. I assume she's gonna hold on to that bucket and, in a month or so, invite me to come to the movie theater to eat popcorn but not see a movie. Can't wait!

Well, it is many years now since he passed away. I was not present in the last weeks of his life, but it seems he may have changed his mind about God and eternal life. I hope he did—I like to think of him at rest and at peace with God. Because that is really what God is talking about in Isaiah 57. In verses 15 and 19, we read:

Well, whaddya know? I'm back and it's only been a week since my last post. That is a remarkable improvement, wouldn't you say? I've noticed a trend in my recipe posts. Have you picked up on it yet? I won't leave you in suspense too long, so I'll just tell you. The recipes I have featured on my blog thus far have been mostly beige in color. It's almost embarrassing. You might as well call this Cheryl's Beige Food Blog. Well, I promise to add a bit of color next go round. What color should I shoot for? Maybe, fuchsia? I don't know, I'll work on it.

Some people move abroad to fulfill a lifelong dream while others are chasing a fantasy. They want to live like Ernest Hemmingway, Josephine Baker or Jack Kerouac. They dream of wrestling fish or picking grapes, falling in love and capturing it all in the next, great American novel. Does it count if the book is written overseas? Doesn’t that make it the next, great Tunisian novel or French novel or at the very least expatriate novel?
Margaret Mahy is one of my all-time favourite writers and, though I don't think this is her best book (the Changeover still has that status for me), it has some wonderful ideas and moments in it. And there is more to come from her, I hope.

As she closed her remarks, Mrs. Obama was quick to point out that while the new icon continues the forward movement of the Let's Move! campaign, there's still miles to go before she sleeps, so to speak.
Despite my new found “independence” however, I was still an extremely disillusioned little kid who, lacking “real world” examples I could look up to, was in desperate need of a hero to emulate. But the thing is that my love for science and my longing for truth had spoiled, for the most part, any fascination I had had with with comic-book style “super” heroes, whose heroic “abilities” derived primarily from accidents of nature.
While government policies supporting private enterprise have been a significant factor in the economic prosperity of Western nations, the notion that support for democratic institutions and social justice are also important foundations is widely shared. Most of my libertarian opponents subscribe to the economic theories of Milton Friedman and argue that unfettered free markets are the only way to achieve a just society. When pressed, most will concede such an economic system is not compatible with representative democracy. Exactly how one could judge whether a society was just, when its members lack the power to chose its leaders, remains a sticky question.

Onto the finals! The format of the final round was a la Iron Chef, with the competitors getting a mystery ingredient unveiled to them on the spot. The secret ingredient was G Joy sake, as well as fresh blackberries that had to be used somehow as a garnish but could also be incorporated into the cocktail. Each finalist had 15 minutes to create and execute a cocktail on the fly, and they were all great!
Similarly, as scholars like William Julius Wilson and Theda Skocpol have noted, targeting within universal programs can provide the redistribution of income and the protection of the entire population that social welfare programs normally provide without the political division. As popular support for the progressive income tax demonstrates, the public is perfectly comfortable with redistribution (indeed, surveys show that the public is comfortable with a much higher level of redistribution than currently exists) as long as the system of redistribution is seen as including everyone.

To me, clothes measure the passage of time in a sense, they help mark our days, our moments. Who hasn't looked back at an old photograph and giggled over the fashions, who hasn't wondered aloud, 'what was I thinking?' when they discover a long-ago buried pants suit in the back of their closet. The only problem I have with all of this is when a bad memory - or maybe even one that was good at the time, but somehow turned sour, is associated with clothes I still own, still want to wear. This happened to me not too long ago actually, when I dug out a sweater I'd worn on what had been a great date...until it suddenly wasn't. I happened to be out in California visiting my brother when I dug the sweater in question, bright blue v-neck piece, out of the bottom of my suitcase.
Good morning everyone, thanks for visiting today. A special 'hello' and thank you to my new followers. I am a very happy bunny today as my half term starts today. I am so ready for this break and looking forward to lots of crafty time and fun with Molly and Lucy; we have kites and bird houses to make and decorate tomorrow - can't wait! Today I have another fairy card made with the same Crafter's Companion stamp set and paper CD that I used on my last card, and the fab EC tool. As my lovely blog friend Christine said about my last card, a very different style for me, but I loved making them.

So the choice before voters is someone who will uphold Oregon law – or someone who makes campaign promises not to enforce the law in order to get votes. I don’t believe the AG gets to make unilateral decisions about which laws to enforce and not enforce. The voters and the legislature expect you to uphold all state laws.

When I decided to think of what I do as "strategic" erasing instead of "destructive" it changed my perspective. I've come to the conclusion that if it works for me, then it's okay. No one is here in my studio staring over my shoulder going "tsk tsk". The result is what matters. And if my techniques free me to create something I couldn't create otherwise, then I say, "So what?!?!"
I love barbecue in (almost) all its forms. For some reason, I don't like brisket at all. I could eat pulled pork all day long. Or mmmm barbecue chicken. Even Sloppy Joe's. The only problem is the ingredients. I've talked a lot before about how I care about what I put into my body. Have you ever taken a look at the ingredients on a bottle of barbecue sauce? Yikes, it’s a mile long, and I can’t pronounce most of them. And the healthy or organic barbecue sauces get expensive, so I got the easy route instead.
Early on I met Angus Fox who showed me an iPhone app that he’s developed for Surrey Police. It must have taken ages to come up with a name for the app: Surrey Police. It let’s front-line staff communicate directly with the public via social media, and helps to make it quick and easy for them to do so. It’s just being piloted in one area at the moment, but will be extended to cover the whole of Surrey later in the year.
I kegged the cluster hopped ale last week. I tasted the hydrometer sample and it was horribly pungent. I did not think I could get the beer past my tongue. A week later it is carbed up and I think the beer is actually good. The pale ale was a single hopped beer with cluster hops and had a lot of late hopping.

He knew instinctively that she wasn’t that way. He couldn’t be absolutely sure, of course, but he’d bet on it. She didn’t put others into neat little boxes because she didn’t put herself in one, and that struck him as refreshing and different, especially when compared with the girls he’d known at Laney.

On the international economic front, the situation on euro area markets improved somewhat compared with the stress peaks experienced in the closing months of 2011. Here, the ECB’s conventional and non-conventional monetary policy measures contributed notably, as did the approval of the second bail-out programme for Greece following the restructuring of its debt in private hands and the progress in the ongoing reform of economic governance in the euro area. However, instability returned in the opening days of April, affecting Spain and Italy acutely owing to the doubts arising over the adjustment processes under way in both countries.

“so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.” Think about slavery, what are its main attributes? Obviously it forces someone to do something, sometimes against their will, sometimes not. In our case, we were willing slaves to sin. Also, it involves complete and utter control; what a slave eats, what he drinks, the place where he lives, even the time he has to wake up is all controlled by his or her master. Now what happens if that slave, after, let’s say a decade, of enslavement, runs away. His or her time as a slave is by this time so ingrained into them, their likely to continue getting up at the same time as they used to, possibly they’ll want to eat and drink the same things they used to, the only real thing that changes is that they no longer have to. But now let’s introduce a third scenario:

We had boring text conversations for about a week. I’m not kidding, his texts were awful. He always sent good morning texts, but they consistently looked like this: “goodmorning.” He would also send text messages that said, “Hi……” I mean, how many dots do you need?

Fred had missed all the downsizing because of a fortuitous decision to take a walk. The soothsayers no longer wished to own a caravan. Upon realizing this Fred strolled over to the east side of his mountain summit. Normally this valley would be bound by fog and nothing would be seen. However, on this cold clear day all could be observed. As he gazed downward into the eastern valley he saw the kingdom of the Count of Computing. This kingdom, from where Fred could view it, was neat and organized methodically.
The Pentagon has announced plans to move additional warships and strike aircraft into the Persian Gulf region to be within striking range of Iran.

A democracy should allow previously repressed Islamists to take part in politics. These Islamists will strive to influence this democracy to further their views. But the system also changes the Islamists. Under the previous regimes, Islamist groups appealed to people simply by merit of their opposition to a dictator. In a democratic system the competition is different. Islamists will have to get elected to have influence, and since there will be no more resistance-against-dictatorship to boast, they need to present a revamped platform to be electable.
My tomato sandwich is irreducibly complex. A bacterial flagellum is, too, and Unlocking the Mystery of Life does a great job showing the marvelous parts of the microscopic propeller. But I don’t have to go to the bacterial flagellum to find irreducible complexity. I see irreducible complexity everywhere in the universe around me. From the perfect placement of the earth from the sun to the perfect placement of the hand on the arm . . . from the life of a baby I hold in my arms to the morality I hold in my heart . . . I am inundated with irreducible complexity.

I have to admit, I’m not sure Rey Sanchez would make my own personal Notorious Mets list if someone else were writing it, but he ranked highly for several Mets bloggers and on several lists so I felt compelled to include him. When I asked some bloggers for blurbs as to “why” though, I had a feeling about the reason, but perhaps Charlie Hangley, concerned Mets fan and blogger over at Mets360, summed it up perfectly in one word: “Haircut.”

Later that night, the new OB on call came in and said, "We will be keeping you until you deliver. Your labs are not great. Specialist will be in to see you tomorrow." I was like I am staying until JULY?? WTHeck. She just smiled and left after the exam & questions. Little did I know what the next 48 hours would be. I asked to shower, and my OB said "Quickly, I will come and drag you out if its too long." Well my mother was there too, so no worries & really relaxing shower on L&D, NOPE!!!
And, as it turned out, there truly have been waves of new experiences, just not in the way I had imagined.
Thanks to all of you who left your wonderful comments on my Birthday Blog Post. I wish I could send you all goodies!! You really make blogging worth it and I love you all! Stayed tuned because I will have some more blog candy soon.

Since graduating 9 months ago he continues to apply himself by studying hard, putting in the extra yards to not just be a Fireman but be the best Fireman he can be. He has a drive, he has a passion for what he does and he applies himself in every aspect of his job and words can not describe how inspiring that is to not only to hear but also to witness.

-The Spring Bling event last Saturday was a huge success! After preparing so hard for this party, I thought I would be able to take this week off. However, I now have several custom orders that I received from customers at the party, and as a result I am very busy, and will not be able to kick back this week as previously planned. Oh well, I guess that is a good thing!

Q: Do you agree with the recently passed law in Arizona that empowers law enforcement officials to check whether a person being stopped or detained is a U.S. citizen?
I was angered and part of me wanted to retaliate with a shout or maybe a rude gesture but I maintained my ladylike composure and sought refuge in the thought that this was all due to a violation of the poor misanthropic primate’s “Monkeysphere”. At that unfortunate moment when I inhibited the frustrated pick-up driver’s effort to make a left-hand turn I had ceased to become a person to him but in fact had simply become “that annoying thing that won’t let me turn!“
My husband is the primary bread eater around here, and eats it either as breakfast toast or an accompaniment to dinner. Since he has never been a fan of rye toast I decided to make this bread as dinner rolls. I had visions of cunningly twisted knots of light and dark dough baking into high-contrast, visually appealing (delicious, of course) puffy rolls.
In Hammond's home-cum-coffee shop she proudly displays a bottle of Amarula, some kitsch tribal masks and a print of a lion, all trinkets her cousin brought back when she visited South Africa on holiday last year. Her Afrikaans is almost unintelligible through her thick Spanish accent and the Spanish words she frequently throws into sentences, but she manages to get her point across in her congenial manner, stumbling when she tries to think of an Afrikaans word she can't remember.
That’s not all. When it comes to solving Europe’s debt woes, Hollande’s view is the antithesis of that of Angela Merkel and German public opinion. He’s already stated that he won’t support the fiscal pact as it currently exists. When it comes to Europe’s finances, he said last week, “It’s not for Germany to decide for the rest of Europe.” He also believes that instead of austerity, the solution to Europe’s debt woes is printing and spending more money. “So many people in Europe are waiting for our victory,” he said recently, “I don’t want a Europe of austerity, where nations are forced on their knees.”

For all the mind-bending technical sorcery, I do have one major gripe with Incurso, and that is the songwriting. Simply put, no song managed to stick with me, even after a dozen listens. It's almost as if the musicians were so busy playing at breakneck speeds and cramming in as many riffs per song as possible, that they forgot they're supposed to be crafting songs, not technical exhibitions. So while I stand in awe of their technical prowess, their latest album is more of a carpe diem affair: get hyperblasted now, remember none of it later.
The semi-competence and, in a few cases, cowardice of the traditional media in covering the Iranian post-election turbulence, coupled with the riveting Twitter messages coming out of Iran, have led to lots of yapping about Twitter and "citizen journalism" as a replacement for traditional reporting.

Joe had to work (and didn’t feel well anyway), so it was just Anna and me last night. We went to a really nice neighborhood and hit up about 20 houses or so. Anna had such a blast! She kept saying, “Mommy, we go to more doors now?” She definitely had the “Trick or Treat” saying down, but I had to prompt her to say it each and every time. She waxed shy every time we’d approach new people. I think she loved being outside so late at night and actually getting candy from people. I think she thinks this is normal – you knock on someone’s door and get candy. Let’s hope she doesn’t try to do this throughout the year.

I tore a page from an old book and distressed it with DI's. The main image, which is from the Flower Market stamp set, was masked off using a Post It note then stamped over with the music stamp from the Artistic Outpost Ephemeral Backgrounds stamp set. I then cut it out using a Nestability, watercoloured the image using re-inkers and then blended more DI around the edge.
The big bang is not just a metaphor or a disputed scientific theory about what occurred 14 billion years ago. It’s happening right now. Something is coming from nothing every second. You might not be conscious of it, but it’s true. Your own experience of action and reaction is not unbroken — there are countless moments of zero between each and every thought, every impulse, and every response. Something is coming from nothing, in and through each and every one of us, constantly. If you slow your experience down, and keep slowing it down, you’ll start to see that there is a vast chasm of empty space that is the foundation of everything that is occurring, the ground out of which each impulse arises. Even as you are aware of the body, of the passing of time and the movement of thought, beneath it all you can become conscious of this current of stillness that is the ground of being.
Chinese, Jewish and white storeowners in America are targeted by rioters for the same reason that Chinese storeowners in Indonesia are. Because they are members of an outside group who are working hard and getting ahead and that is the worst imaginable crime to people who believe that success through honest work is impossible. That anyone who succeeds has taken advantage of a rigged system and is exploiting them to get ahead.
What is not wanted are people who really are engineers, or farmers or cooks. The assembly line has no room for thinking outside the proscribed process.

In 2006 at the San Diego Comic-Con I met Moebius. It was a once in a lifetime chance and one of my most cherished comic-con moments. I realized the importance and the rarity of my brief meeting. There I was, just some guy from Missouri meeting an art legend from France. Ah, the beauty of Comic-Con!
That is one beautiful piece of fruit! It stopped me in my tracks when I turned the corner at Whole Foods and saw a whole display of them. I had never seen a dragon fruit before. I’ve heard of them, because I remember seeing, a few years ago, a dragon fruit-flavored Snapple product, but I didn’t assume it was an actual, real fruit. I thought it was a made up word for marketing purposes, like how Kool-Aid made up a flavor when I was a kid called Purplesaurus Rex, which, believe it or not, was neither the name of a flavor found in nature NOR an actual dinosaur.

The bcurious is very good value for money. If you’re new to toys and want an high-quality, entry-level vibe that isn’t an intimidating penetrative job, the bcurious won’t disappoint. If you’ve got a range already but want to upgrade your hand held external stimulator to one that’s smarter, sexier, rechargeable and waterproof, the bcurious is definitely the way to go. So, basically, I love it. Run out and buy it. But even if you don’t, just go try that thuck thuck thuck brrrrrr against your hip bone and then imagine that between your legs. Dreams are made of this.

I've never had a gel manicure, and can't see myself getting one anytime soon. I paint my nails so frequently, I'd be heartbroken to not be able to change my polish daily if I'd like! I've considered getting a gel manicure for vacations, wedding weekends, etc. but then I remembered that I pack nail polish tools and paints everywhere I go. It's just as important as underwear for me!
So it goes….
After a few days of this I noticed my skin started to take on a different appearance. A glowing golden look that was kind of nice when I put some coconut oil on it. I also noticed some leaves appeared on the trees and some grass growing. Then I thought perhaps..if grass could grow, maybe flowers would..so I planted some. My neighbours did the same and now it's just a beautiful colourful paradise in my neighbourhood! What a miracle!

All this fresh blog loveliness has had me thinking about transformations. I've always been drawn to the caterpillar-to-butterfly story. Something about that chubby, sweet looking caterpillar inching along - munching whatever bright green leaves she can get her hands on... limited by lack of speed on her very short legs. She is completely focused on the leaf she's on. Chomp chomp chomp. Taking care of business. Then she instinctively knows it's time to wrap herself up and get to work on the radical stuff of changing her whole self!

Green’s Quest
In Rabelais, there is much revelry, excess, and corruption. He who feasts, defecates. The grotesque body, in such a society, is one that emits and one which is porous to the world around it. So here we have Bottom Dog and his companion, navigating the copiously developed, seemingly lush Floridian landscape. What they are really traversing may be the over-fished, deforested, gentrified mirage of a southern state where the wetlands dry up and the coasts erode.
But back to London. There are so many things I will miss. The feeling of being somewhere important. Reading someone else’s newspaper on the tube and train. Loosing any sense of a personal bubble. The smell of London, smoke, alcohol. Pretty much sums it up. The general excitement of big city lights and the possibility of seeing someone important! The number of men in suits. Well dressed men! Metro over here is hot! People drinking beer on the trains – GBs. The people you meet on trains – the absolutely wasted couple after church, man holding onto my collar so I wouldn’t fall over, that was borderline creepy…the numerous people on the trains we have pissed off. The young children on the bus after church. The boys who put tic tacs in Jacqui’s dimples. The amount of people we have fallen on, inappropriately grabbed and scared for life with our conversations which we should have in the walls of our bedrooms not in public, Pulling faces at people as the tube drives away because let’s face it we won’t see them again. Ever. I think in general I will miss the people, so many people walk around not giving a shit what others think and just want to have fun. Ah. Love you London.
75 Sit-ups
The book isn’t perfect and there was a definate lul in the action about halfway through. The low points in the book for me included the time Bluebear spends in the desert and the congladiator battles in the city of Atlantis (where gladiators compete with each other to thrill the audience with the most intricate and entertaining lies) both of which dragged on and bored me quite a bit but this was unusual as the rest of the book is very action-packed.

“Good King Wenceslas, yes. ‘Bring me flesh and bring me wine’…” Craig smiled. “Yes, still one of my best performances I have to admit, but a discussion we can save for another occasion.

How this was going through my mind over and over today...
This question of how authorities should respond when flawed forensics are discovered will continue to come up, and not just at the federal level. Here in Texas when flawed arson science was uncovered in the Todd Willingham and Ernest Willis cases, the Forensic Science Commission partnered with my employers at the Innocence Project of Texas and the state fire marshal to reexamine old arson cases for possible false convictions. And when the El Paso crime lab was found to be employing an incompetent analyst, DA Jaime Esparza was praised for notifying local defense counsel. OTOH, when Texas appellate courts decided dog-sniff lineups weren't good enough evidence to support a conviction, nobody in officialdom ever tried to identify the 2,000 cases where Deputy Keith Pikett claimed to have performed the technique, much less instances where flawed testimony may have been central to securing a conviction. And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has generally refused to grant habeas writs based on debunked scientific testimony, even when it was central to securing a conviction. So as a practical matter Texas' response to flawed forensics, while superior in some cases to the feds', has overall been rather hit or miss.
Every problem is solvable all you have to do is put one step in front of the other and walk a little a day. The steps accumulate and after a week you’re a different person than when you first started out. You got relationship problems, find out the extent of the problem, research and study for solutions and attack the problem a little at a time. Asking for help is OK trust me.

The chief feature of the house is the eastern portico, which is 58 feet wide and 29 feet high, and supports a 6 foot tall entablature. The columns, topped with expertly carved Ionic capitals, were supposedly made of pine from Bastrop. Each tapered column consists of wooden staves, fitted together like those of a barrel, and there are several discs inside the column to ensure it keeps it shape. The fluting, or ridges, on the outside of the columns, was carved by hand.

Once in position, the exerciser should lower his glutes to the floor while keeping his feet flat on the ground and head facing forward. The glutes should never lower past the knees. To increase the resistance, one should hold free weights in straightened arms.
Gameplay is easy to learn as you can opt to have in-game hints, or step up to the challenge with minimal aid. Combat is stress-inducing as weapons are obviously scarce, requiring Alan Wake-like concocting on the fly. Strategy comes into play as you rid of walker scum with caution not to turn a stealthy kill of one into a manic killing of a swarm. But make sure you are quick with your button pushing. A sluggish reaction to the real-time button input, and you’re zombie meat. I was a bit too slow in one of my game-changing decisions (each choice you make, whether in combat or conversation, alters the episode) and the whole fleet succumbed. It definitely keeps you on your toes.
“Roberts is dead. The Flying Hare went down in that typhoon with all hands on deck, remember? Dead men hold no grudges, Janus van Koonns. I can’t fault him for that grudge, though.

We flew from here to the Americas more than once to earn that pay out, and I truly wish Roberts had gotten that duty instead.”

This past weekend we drove 3 hours to help my daughter and son-in-law move into their new apartment and to attend a wedding. Last week I printed this pattern. It was the perfect car project. It took me almost the exact length of the drive to make it (at a very nonchalant pace)! We were staying with friends and when I arrived, Sue put the vest on her antique bear and now, that's where it lives...

This meeting in particular was what I call a ‘Public Reading Event’. There was now real exchange of ideas, debate or in depth discussion. Rather a few people stood in front of copy heavy power point slides and read it out to the people sitting around eating muffins and pretending to listen. A total waste of time and the $8250. This is before we add to the price the opportunity cost of real work that wasn’t done during the 5 hours, or the cost of the meeting ‘culture’ it creates. And we all know a strong ‘meeting culture’ results in a vortex of indecision and slow business practice.

Surely with an easier product it would actually end up costing less for the company to run all these travel programs and enhancing their passengers experience. This is one of the reasons I shy away from the behemoth American carriers, their confusing fare structure and fundamentally weaker onboard offering continue to baffle non-American passengers. They should perhaps look at the newer LCC carriers in America on how they manage to successfully add ancillary revenue in a simple and much more manageable way.
I cried the entire time, I felt like I had already gone through so much the last few months and now that I am finally feeling better this happens. What did I do wrong? Then Garett came in to console me some more and I just said, "I really wanted this baby." I just kept saying it. I couldn't help but fall in love with it as soon as I found out I was pregnant. You know some people don't know that sometimes you feel that attachment right away, and the love is there and it's very strong. I sat there for what felt like forever just crying. Then I had to scoop my baby into a bag so the Dr. could run tests and I thought, "This is my baby, in this little ziplock bag, why?" it was the hardest thing I've ever done.
Wherefore, enter ye all into the joy of your Lord; Receive your reward, both the first, and likewise the second. You rich and poor together, hold high festival! You sober and you heedless, honour the day! Rejoice today, both you who have fasted and you who have disregarded the fast. The table is full-laden; feast ye all sumptuously. The calf is fatted; let no one go hungry away. Enjoy ye all the feast of faith: receive ye all the riches of loving-kindness.
That's because looking at something beautiful releases all the same chemicals in our brains -- epinephrine, dopamine and endorphins -- as when we fall in love, achieve a runner's high or take drugs. These chemicals are largely responsible for our feelings of enjoyment, motivation and happiness.

Well, they have announced their own 'consultation' - an idiotic idea, not only because it is about six months too late, but because Barnet Tories never take the slightest bit of notice of any consultation, especially any real opposition to policies, and indeed Brian Coleman, the Cabinet member for environmental issues prides himself on his refusal to listen to petitions, emails and pleas from residents foolishly attempting to persuade him that he might actually, er, sshh, be wrong about something ...

The Powells are about to go from ordinary to extraordinary. After 16 years of marriage, Jim and Stephanie's relationship lacks the spark it once had, and their family life now consists of balancing work and their two children, leaving little time for family bonding. During a family vacation set up by Jim in an attempt to reconnect, their plane crashes into the Amazon River. But this is where the fun starts for the Powells, as they soon discover that something's not quite right. Each of them now possesses unique and distinct superpowers. But saving and savoring their family life will be equally important, as they try to find purpose for their new powers and embark on a journey to find out what defines and unifies them. The Powells are a totally relatable family who happen to be a little bit amazing. - ABC

4 p.m.: A friend of mine in Missira (northeast of downtown) says he hasn’t been out of his house all day — too much shooting going on. He mentions that at least one shop in his neighborhood was looted last night. Meanwhile, the BBC says troops have looted the presidential palace at Koulouba. Here in Badalabougou, though, the shots are increasingly few and far between. Perhaps the CNRDR’s call on soldiers to stop firing into the air is having some impact.
Everyone has tunes that transport them from the present to the past. Songs that make the little hairs on your arm tingle and nostalgia stir up from the depths. Music that reminds you of friends, that you know whenever you hear it, you will always think of them.

French onion soup is one of those foods that captured me utterly as a child and I've loved it since the first moment I tasted the hot, salty beef broth full of tender onions, gooey cheese, and soup-soaked bread. It quickly became one of those items that, if I saw it on a restaurant menu, I had to order it. Maybe it's that childhood memory, but even after having had it countless of times at many varied dining establishments, from the modest to the highbrow, I still think Mimi's Cafe, the location of that first taste of heaven, serves some of the best French onion soup around.

I am hot. This summer has been horrible, and now it is August 1st, which means that we have at least two more months of this shit. I have moved on from being frustrated and sizzled into boredom by the relentless swelter, and now I am just hot and angry. There is no rain, few clouds, and everything is dead or dying. Tempers are short, and the nights offer no respite.

We could see the hotel where the wedding would be from the ferry. It was a very fancy hotel with a beautiful view of the city from huge wrap-around windows, with flowers everywhere, paper lanterns hanging from the high ceilings . . . That's a big difference with French weddings, they tend to be in small village halls here. Though I suppose in bigger cities ballrooms in hotels might be common. Restaurants are common here too, for smaller groups. Out where I live, it's usually in the multipurpose room across the square from the town hall. I feel like in the states, the venue is extremely important. Tons of flowers in lush interiors, urban lofts with ice sculptures, lights galore in a marquee in the woods. Here, the food seems to take center stage, in functional rooms with tile floors and nice but not overly ambitious decorations. And really, all of this could be regional. I have been to a wedding at a chateau, which was lovely, but there aren't tons of chateaux in the area, so maybe other more chateau-y regions have nicer reception halls. And I'll bet people who live closer to the beach in France use it for weddings. At least, I hope they do!

“Stand up”, Lamar commanded in a loving yet stern tone.
I was going to leave it there but have to say- there's been a lot of debate about Anne Hathaway's accent in this film and, yes, it is patchy but she plays the character of Emma beautifully. I think she did an interview saying that she decided if she focussed too much on the accent she wouldn't be able to focus on the acting and I respect her choice. She really is a lovely Emma, so I just had to block out the accent. And the film introduced me to Jim Sturgess forwhich I will be forever grateful.

It is about time I posted some of these. As some of you might know I had the misfortune of having the vast bulk of my sketchbooks and non-digital photos (covering a period of over twenty years!) stolen earlier this year by someone who pretended to be doing me a favour but was in fact a thieving toerag of the highest order. I can forgive the books, the vinyl LPs, the CDs, the board games and fan-made Doctor Who DVDs that vanished with the culprit, but losing the photo archive and the artwork really hurt. So now I have no alternative but to rely on the already scanned scrapings that I manage to dredge up here and there on any hard drives or USB pens that haven’t become corrupted over the intervening years. First up is two pages of a comic drawn as a birthday card for Adam Easterbrook, heaven knows how many years ago. I gave him the originals but kept a set of photocopies. Sadly this scanned image is all that survives. I don’t think the artwork is anything to write home about but the pacing and story aren’t too shabby.

Personally, I am bit disheartened because I had dreamed of using the Kindle platform to purchase book after book at that magic price of $9.99. Those dreams have been shattered. Standing back however from my disappointment, this apparently steady increase in the price of e-books is a fascinating example of a nascent industry seeking to find a workable pricing model.
We tried so hard last year to find a way to make a nice cup o’ in the car; tried to find a gas station open early enough for a steamer; I sweetly batted my eyelashes at my boyfriend to wait for me to build a fire and boil some water (no time…lighting is money honey!); attempted to wane myself off the addicting brown stuff…

A movement/entity it is never attacked from without before it destroys itself from within. The national interests are not at stakes from spies but rather at the political bureaucrats who are supposed to serve the needy population but instead are doing worse than nothing.
Even worse, ethnic Russians who stay in Russia achieve fertility rates less than 1.5 child per woman -- even with pro-natal Kremlin policies -- while Chechen women maintain fertility rates well above 3 children per woman. Two thirds of births from ethnic Russian women are from women between the ages of 20 and 29 -- a part of the population that happens to be shrinking at this time. In less than 15 years, the number of Russian women in that age group are estimated to be reduced by almost 50%.

By the way I think the Norfolk Island Pine is a brilliant idea. I’ve been really bah-humbug this year and haven’t put up a tree or decorated. It wears me out just thinking about it, but David’s Norfolk Island Pine inspired me…if Lowe’s or Home Depot has one to buy…now. I need a quickie Christmas redo since I’m having everyone over on Christmas Day and having nothing Christmas-y just doesn’t seem right. Trying to stay mellow and anxiety-free this Christmas season has merely meant opting out for me, and now with days to go I’m feeling like opting back in. I have become really ambivalent about this wonderful season meant for celebrating my Savior’s birth. Sadly and invariably, I experience less savior and more stress. It’s just occurring to me that doing nothing is not the answer to doing too much which I used to do with incredibly disastrous results. Happy mediums have never been my strong suit, being naturally inclined to be either way over there or way over there. Avoiding Christmas Eve conniptions has become my holiday goal, so I have adopted a laissez-faire attitude. Well, I’m only 61, so I’ve still got time to get this right.
The third weekend of the month brought a pretty fun-filled day Saturday. My buddy Mark was in town for the weekend visiting his brother in Philly, so I went into Philly in the afternoon and hung out with him and had a couple solid beers. Later that night, my friends Keith and Fran had their house warming party, which was also a very good time! It was really good to see some friends that I haven't hung out with in awhile and to help Keith and Fran break in the house a little.
I think that was one thing that most impressed me about the movie -- the "group" of male friends that was portrayed. Why are so many men afraid to have real friends? Why do they fear conversation? And why do they shy away from revealing anything about themselves? Why do they find it "weak" to let people know the real person? What is it they are trying to hide? Why do they not want anyone to know they are "human"?
If Mary-Emma sewed one more lacy bit for one more wedding, she would … she would … She had no idea what she would do, really, and not having that idea, shoved the handkerchief into the sewing basket with remarkable vigor.
Fast paced, with mystery about Ben's past, romantic entanglements, totally loony killers from a hidden Catholic sect and a corrupt Archbishop. The book reads like it was originally a Hollywood screen play, gates "breaking like Balsa wood", glass shattering around him... etc. It is ok if you want a fast paced thriller which as little believability ... however Mr Mariani claims at the end that this is all well researched. Maybe on the key points of the story but then it is let down by poor research and other non believable stuff. We're told Mr Hope only ever deals in cash which he gets from a safe deposit box... once... but he buys a car, a motorbike, rents numerous hotel suites and villas etc. all I can say is Mr Hope must have a jacket with bloody big pockets! Also sadly for a real nitpickity sod like me a Citroen 2CV car is made an unlikely hero in a scene involving a level crossing... the 2CV is mortally wounded in this encounter as we're told the water is pouring from it's radiator... funny 2CV only ones I've ever seen were air cooled! I know a silly little thing but really if it had been a Clio I'd not have thought - couldn't you have wiki'd that to be certain?

Not to be outdone by the Shaivites, the Iyengar Design Institute Of Typography submitted their stylized vision for the Rupee symbol. Being a politically shrewder lot, they pointed out that the choice of English will keep the Southern political parties happy and what’s even better, the “naamam” part even looks slightly like the rising sun. But it was rejected on the basis of a massive protest by the Association of Pencil Manufacturers (led by Natraj) who complained that the symbol looked too much like the nib of a pen and therefore was offensive to pencils.
Even the six-hour drive home was enjoyable (if a little nerve-wracking) because we listened to The Hunger Games. What a great book! I can't wait to get the next one now.

Located in the Renaissance Indianapolis hotel on North Meridian, Grille 39 may be ignored because it is a hotel restaurant. Usually, if you live in the area, you don’t visit hotels thus ignoring the restaurants within. As someone who travels for work, I have no problem with many hotel restaurants. In this case, I was looking forward to the atmosphere that blended well with the Renaissance feel of earthly elements. Together, the two fit nicely, and I was impressed with the overall experience of the restaurant that evening.
Next week, however, we're going to make our first attempt at homemade ham, and will possibly have that ham for our Easter dinner. I'll let you know.
Plus side, I did leave the city with some fairly decent reads, some of which I’ve added to The Pile. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas might be something I should consider re-reading, if only to ensure I hadn’t missed anything amid all the drug-induced hallucinations and conflicts that occurred throughout the book.

While in a grocery store this morning, I had a brief chat with a woman who was admiring the hyacinths. She picked up a pot for me to sniff and told me about the big purple blooms in her own garden.
I know it has been a while since my last post, but I haven't been feeling well. Rather than me bellyaching, let's just say my MS has really kicked me in the butt.. well, actually, this time it has hit my arms. (The left is worst than ever, but the right is slowly regaining strength/sensation... praise heaven!!) I've been feeling quite useless and down as of late. You know what - disease sucks! Well, that's all together another story for another time. Luckily, I have a strong support network and I am working through this latest hurtle.
6. Auditing of accounts is made difficult when officials of the Party leave and do not hand over Petty Cash Books or other Party property, in some cases a deliberate ploy in an attempt to embarrass the Party.
Whose change are you helping to pick up? Whose helping you pick up your change? As a body of Christ, are we are all on our knees together, picking up the change together, so that together we can run again, laughing with joy? It’s not change that makes life difficult, it’s the attitude we choose to bring to the tile.

I'm really getting tired of people at work with nothing to do. It seems like it's perfectly fine for them to interrupt those of us who are actually working and actually have things to do just because they're bored. They're too busy shopping on E-Bay to do what we asked her to do, but it's perfectly OK for her to come downstairs and run her mouth and get up in everyone's shit and then get annoyed with us because we don't respond. I'm going to have to start brining earplugs or listening to the iPod at maximum volume so I can tune everyone who isn't someone I work close with out. I can't wait until the big boss comes back, then everyone will calm down and act like the adults I know they are supposed to be.

One commentary says, “The work he has come to do is now complete.

Abigail has her secrets – and some of them are lethal. Abigails’ storyline lost me several times through the book; by the end I don’t think it was satisfyingly resolved or even explained. The main feeling I had at the end was confusion. I will probably need to re-read several times before I feel I have a complete handle upon it.
So, I was listening to my Me First and the Gimme Gimmes playlist and on came their cover of my favorite Bond theme, Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better”. This made me want to listen to the original which in turn made me want to listen to more Bond songs. So, since I did that I figured I’d share my top 5 favorite Bond songs.

Despite the U.S. Senate’s rejection of cap-and-trade legislation, the carbon-tax agenda is still being implemented in America and around the world. Using the Environmental Protection Agency, the Obama administration is moving forward on regulating emissions of carbon dioxide at the federal level. And through alliances and agreements between states and even foreign governments — unconstitutional under Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution — those same forces are building a powerful and expensive carbon regime that could eventually encompass every state in the Union, and beyond.
What this means is that once you learn to recognize the signs of a speculative bubble, it’s possible to make exact predictions of future events with perfect confidence. A fair number of people—I was one of them, as longtime readers of this blog will recall—did that with the real estate bubble that popped so catastrophically in 2008. Few bubbles in economic history showed the signs of imminent trouble more clearly than this one, and while all but a tiny fraction of economists missed those signs, they were not lost on less blinkered observers. As Keith Brand over at the HousingPanic blog—a voice of sanity all the way through the bubble—used to say, “Dear God, this is going to end so badly.” He was right; his more specific predictions, and those of a lot of other bubble bloggers, were by and large square on targer; and those who derided them—and there were a lot of them, some with impressive credentials—have spent the last three years doing their best to pretend that they didn’t make fools of themselves.
Once you know what you are looking for on the labels, it’s time to start shopping. Browse your local pet store food aisle, or perform a quick research online. Find a Cat Food that is grain-free, low carbohydrate, and protein-rich and will deliver the meats and poultry your feline craves. Make sure it contains ingredients and nutrient levels which most closely resemble the ancestral diet of cats. Similar to a diet felines would experience in a natural environment, it is essential to provide cats with energy and nutrients derived from meat-based proteins and highly digestible fats.
I’m inclined to say that it’s simply a matter of quality. The Scottsboro Boys was a brilliant show. At once devastating and hopeful, it was about how far we have (and haven’t) come as a nation and our collective history of racial intolerance. I believe that. But I also question my response since I’m, y’know…really white.

Tivoli is located in a neighborhood that once suffered harshly from lack of investment and the crack epidemic. Today, this same neighborhood is rapidly changing due to gentrification. Tivoli Towers is one of the few buildings in the neighborhood that has not been gentrified as yet, due to its status in the city-sponsored Mitchell-Lama affordable housing program. When the landlord recently tried to sell the building and remove it from the Mitchell-Lama Program, the tenants sued — and won. Since several NYC landlords have successfully removed their buildings from this program, this proved to be a landmark decision and important victory in 2005.

There was a smaller studio around the corner from the hallway. I stopped by the front door. It was The Crooning Cowboy show. The Crooning Cowboy as you could guess was a singing cowpoke picking tunes off the shiniest guitar I’ve ever seen. Since the studio was so small he couldn’t really afford a fancy backdrop, just a mike and his guitar.

Zahir wasn't the first to mix "classical" instruments like oud or qanun with street music. The celebrated Houcine Slaoui (the father of Moroccan chaabi music, IMHO) was doing this in the 1940's. However, Hamid Zahir's recordings kick out the jams a bit more - perhaps because Slaoui was recording on 78rpm discs, while Zahir, who rose to fame in the 1960s, made recordings on 45s and LPs.

The wider area of focus here is what is termed in English as “Greater Syria.” In Arabic that part is known as ash-Sham (al-Sham), which covers what today is Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestinian territories, and Jordan (more or less). This area was original divided in four counties, “ajnad” in plural, “jund” in singular, which were Jund al-Dimashq, Jund al-Hims, Jund al-Urdun, and Jund al-Filastin, where we also find Jerusalem. Later a fifth jund was added, or created out of Jund al-Hims, namely Jund al-Qinnasrin.
Yes, that’s where my mind went. I’ve never been so scared in my life.
The RAND report calls this approach “energy services analysis.” The idea is that focusing on the human wants and needs that energy is used to satisfy, and working backward from there, would free people to see the gross inefficiencies that may be lurking within our old habits. It’s not an entirely new idea, of course, but the RAND report is one of the clearest expositions of it that I have seen.

Then the bass player showed up and said he was going to play the guitar instead. He didn't know how to play the guitar, but the Heir could show him, surely. By July. He'd got to talking to his friends and the drummer that played parts of Aerosmith songs was going to re-join.
What in the world would make someone imply that I am NOT smart because I make sacrifices to homeschool my children? I'm doing what God has called me and told me to do. Proverbs 22:6 tells us, "Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it." I am convicted that I cannot train them up in the way they should go if they're at school more than they're at home during waking hours. They're not just learning the 3 Rs at our house. They're not just learning history facts and dates at our house. My boys are learning how to serve GOD!

At the weekend I was lucky enough to receive another present bomb, this time from Raveller LaurelAW. She sent me three lovely pieces of felt- I'm especially excited about the leopard skin pattern and the brown piece at the back of the photo is textured, so I think both of those will make great felties.

Always curious, I insisted we go see what was happening but when I saw all those lobsters crawling over each other in those traps I felt sick. A few had gotten out onto the wharf and were clicking along, towards the water, but large paws of hands tossed them back with the others.
This time I did a little more research. I found the book Caffeine Blues by Stephen Cherniske, M.S. He is a researcher and clinical nutritionist. He 100% convinced me that caffeine is bad news and I committed myself to “getting off the bean”, as he says in his book. Here is what I discovered. Tomorrow I will post about HOW I quit coffee without any headache or fatigue. Yes, it can be done.
Granted, laughing is simple, universal, and can help you burn calories, but there are better ways to let him know how much you appreciate his sense of humor. “Fire the humor back at him,” suggests Dr. Kudia. “If you can hold your own when the sarcasm starts flying, you’ll be able to compliment him by saying how great it is to meet someone with the same sense of humor.”

While I waited for them, at least two people who walked by me declared to their companions that they would NOT go down that thing. I don't think it was dangerous or too crazy, and frankly I wish that high speeds didn't give me such an unpleasant feeling. I wanted to go down it, but knew I would not enjoy it.

Twenty-seven sounds a lot older to me than 26. Obviously it is older, but it sounds A LOT older than say 22 to 23 or 24 to 25. Maybe it is because I am now officially in my late twenties and finally feel like I have to consider myself an adult. Along those lines, this year Spencer and I will be celebrating our SEVENTH wedding anniversary. Which also sounds A LOT longer than six years of marriage.
This one we obtained from the drinks/ dessert stall at the Food Junction (a food court) at the bottom of the Great World City shopping mall.

It’s understandable. After I finished writing my manuscript, SHAKEN NOT STIRRED…A CHEMO COCKTAIL, I decided to take off this spring and summer, from my tennis addiction, to focus on editing and publishing my book. (And promoting The SCAR Project coming to Cincinnati this fall, which has been crazy busy fun.) So that’s why my tennis girlfriends were being so ridiculous, acting like we were meeting for the first time, and as if the wine bottles were house warming gifts, instead of a case of catching up.

He was mildly amusing at times, so I wasn't always offended by his presence in small doses. But he would usually remind me quickly why I didn't like him very much.

There was still quite a bit of it remaining. I watched in shock as he opened the US Mailbox, which was positioned next to the garbage can, and dropped his drippy yogurt cone into it.
I have this one for a couple of years, yet it doesn't seem like it, as it takes just a touch of the roll on to make you smell as fab as a gorgeous garden at summer in midnight.

I cursed the light of your gaze
Friends~I just realized that the school year is super close to being over! I don't know how this happened so fast...without me noticing. I was just planning away for next week and there it was...the end of April. It got me thinking about what I can do to keep my kiddos on track this summer. We just finished out reading and math bench marks and while my kiddos rocked them I know how easily they can lose it by not practicing over the summer.

On one hand, the answer is a resounding “Heck No.” What’s in front of me is a first draft. It needs to be read and re read and edited and all those Face-palming grammatical, typographical and continuity slip-ups need to be corrected. All that, however is fodder for another post.

Looking forward to a lunch dominated by honey-baked ham, even if that ham’s primary purpose is to serve as a vehicle for getting heaps of stoneground mustard into my belly (just like lobster:butter, artichoke:aioli, pancakes:syrup, the list goes on. Why wasn’t this on the PSATs?). Also I really need something to balance out the pounds of carrot cake already in there. Because while it makes perfect sense to follow a recipe that leaves enough batter to fill an extra round cake pan for taste tests, that’s only if you aren’t the sole person testing, and only if you don’t rationalize that an extra slice with toasted coconut, and another with a dusting of finely chopped walnuts, will allow you to narrow down the topping options.
Today at 2 o'clock, I found myself strangely not drop-dead tired as usual. I wrapped a birthday present for a 3-year-old little friend whose birthday party we were scheduled to go to after naptime (which precarious roads prevented us from getting to after all.) The last ribbon tied, I did a strange thing. I didn't hop into bed. I continued to work on crafts. And I realized that while Oliver's naptime provided much-needed me-time, I can't always appreciate that it exists if I'm unconscious. I can't spend happy time with my glue gun, cardstock, and photos if I'm busy dreaming hormonal, super-weird dreams. In addition to the birthday gift and its wrapping job, I happily completed three hand-made cards and the beginnings of an ornament.
My next review is Kiersten White's Paranormalcy. Right now, I'm trying to describe how useful it is to a writer without sounding like a stalker. White's book is interesting coming down the line after I've reviewed a self-published book, a small press book (well, semi-small press) and now a release from Harperteen. While I review each work on its merits and not some faux analysis of publishers and other irrelevant industry factoids, I'm digging the diversity of fiction that makes its way to my nightstand.

Upon the other hand, while I believe that the emergency powers had ceased in June 1945, I am not prepared to hold that all executive orders issued thereafter under Commonwealth Act No. 671, are per se null and void. It must be borne in mind that these executive orders had been issued in good faith and with the best of intentions of three successive Presidents, and some of them may have already produced extensive effects in the life of the nation. We have, for instance, Executive Order No. 73, issued on November 12, 1945, appropriating the sum of P6,750,000 for public works; Executive Order No. 86, issued on January 7, 1946, amending a previous order regarding the organization of the Supreme Court; Executive Order No. 89, issued on January 1, 1946, reorganizing the Courts of First Instance; Executive Order No. 184, issued on November 19, 1948, controlling rice and palay to combat hunger; and other executive orders appropriating funds for other purposes. The consequences of a blanket nullification of these executive orders will be unquestionably serious and harmful. And I hold that before nullifying them, other important circumstances should be inquired into, as for instance, whether or not they have been ratified by the Congress expressly or impliedly, whether their purposes have already been accomplished entirely or partially, and in last instance, to what extent; acquiescence of litigants; de facto officers; acts and contrast of parties acting in good faith; etc. It is my opinion that each executive order must be viewed in the lights of its peculiar circumstances, and, if necessary and possible, before nullifying it, precautionary measures should be taken to avoid harm to public interest and innocent parties.

We cannot calculate the length and breadth of even this universe, yet there are millions and millions of universes like this one within the material sky. And above this material sky there is another sky, which is called the spiritual sky. In that sky all the planets are eternal, and life is eternal, also. We cannot know these things by our material calculations, so we must take this information from the Bhagavad-gītā.
Meanwhile, The Typhoons - a session band previously known to handle The Beatles material on Embassy, although I don't know if the personnel remained the same throughout all their recordings - battle with "Mr Tambourine Man". It's a fey, gentle take which sounds influenced more by English folk than the American folk rock scene that spawned The Byrds, sounding sleepy and contended rather than urgent, preaching and elated. Readers won't be in a hurry to replace The Byrds version on their iPods with this one, but once again the different approach is at least an interesting interpretation.
It was a good sleep. This one had an exhilarating dream. It was surely a sign from Hircine, my shadowy lord of the hunt. Rajiir found himself in the form of a great wolf, bounding through the wilds of Skyrim. I ran through the mountains, climbing ever higher until I reached the spot where I had stood to look out over Dawnstar earlier that day. I felt the soil and snow beneath my great paws. I felt a connection to the wilds that I had never before experienced. It was incredible. I was filled with a purpose, and my great wolf form padded out towards the ruins on the other side of Dawnstar. I ran fast in this new form, and I reached my goal in no time. There I stood outside an ancient Dwemer ruin. Beneath me I saw vague, wisp-like shadows moving all around. I could not detect their forms, but I knew they were enemies. They smelled like arrogance and death. As I charged down the slopes, I could practically taste the blood of the shadows. I could smell the excitement of the hunt. As I leaped at the first bandit, I was woken from my dream. It had to be a sign from Hircine. I was sure of it.

Hello Everyone, Angie Blom here with some great NEWS!!
On paper, the new Dervish QV7 is a terrible pen. However, on other surfaces, it’s excellent. It draws exceedingly well on orange peel, bricks, sponge (both kitchen and bobsquarepants), chips (US and English), fannies (US) and bums (UK). Granted, if you ever attempt to write on a piece of paper with the QV7, it will fall apart, but as long as you remember this it should serve you well. I highly recommend it for scribbling an insult onto a potato and throwing it at a nearby Jesuit.
and now for something almost completely different…
This, The Letter, is for Future Cindy.
What’s troubling is that Chairman McKeon’s post gives you the impression that it defends sec. 1021—the discretionary detention provision—when, in fact, his post is all about sec. 1022, the mandatory provision. The post conspicuously defends “the provision,” without referencing a specific section number. And, at the end, it includes a chart titled “Section 1021 of the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act,” even though one of the two quotes in the chart is from sec. 1022, not 1021.
But now it's September, and a time for a fresh start and a new copybook ready to be blotted. It is time to Be Positive and jolt Penny Dolan's Dire Diary blog a bit closer to what I'd like it to be. So I am creating some new categories. They aren't stunning but maybe they'll help me get blogging more often.
Yet I see no force for them anywhere, no voice for the poor ,the hard done by, the lonely and the disabled, the old look back to a better age whilst the young look to a nothing future, plastic engulfs the very nation and the east grows fat upon the pound. Yes unfairness drives me to anger, anger because its is all I have ever known and I expect all I will ever know, I see the predator moving among good people, the criminal amassing wealth and the worker paying thee greatest criminals of all and I seek change, seek freedom from it but a lone voice creates no resonance. My life has been one of poverty, of scrimp and scrap, of shoddy diet and shoddy goods, of yes I suppose envy of those who have and anger at the plight of the many. Yet it is not so much for myself I lament, although I am still young enough to still desire a life, still yearn for freedom from financial slavery but for my children, for that most precious of things to me, my children.
“You’ve got a memory like an elephant”, her pa used to say. She brushed off his fussing, “Just because I remember where the Vegemite is when I visit …” But he was right. She did have a memory like an elephant, and she carried her past around like a packed lunch. Every day she would unwrap, indulge, stew, poke, prod, and pack it away to do it all again tomorrow. Sometimes it was intentional, and kind, like buying herself a box of chocolates: a memory of a smile from a handsome man on the train, a treat to make her heart feel light. Mostly she was consumed by the dull echo of ‘what if?’

This is the riveting first-person narrative of Kvothe, a young man who grows to be one of the most notorious magicians his world has ever seen. From his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that transports readers into the body and mind of a wizard.
When the case was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, they ruled in his favor, giving the Army General title over the United States, Inc. Legal action was then passed on to the Senate Finance Committee and Senator Sam Nunn, who was working with Roy Schwasinger. With the help of covert congressional and political pressure, President George H.W. Bush issued an Executive Order (a) on Oct. 23, 1991, which provided a provision allowing anyone who has a claim against the federal government to receive payment as long as it’s within the rules of the original format of the case.
The radiologist who does all of Austin’s ultrasounds is unexpectedly out of the hospital until Monday. Usually, some other doctor could take over that function but Austin’s kidney is so misshapen and, well, abnormal that we really need the one guy who’s familiar with it to do this all-important scan. Otherwise, we’d end up with a messy reading and wishy-washy results and then they’d probably want to do it again in a few weeks.

Every fantasy novel has a hook, or some aspect that drives our imagination. On the surface, my hook is that the teens can manipulate the elements—earth, water, wind, and fire. But in deciding how they control the elements, and to what end, I thought very hard about the Outer Banks, and what it would be like to grow up in a tiny, remote colony, untouched by the rest of human kind. I realized that someone with the element of water would have less use for creating a tsunami than for reading the shifting tides, and the predicting the impact of storm swells. Those who grow up on small islands have a unique relationship with land and water, I believe, and this book gave me the chance to incorporate fantastical elements within a setting that is both striking, and yet recognizably real world.

So I used painter’s tape to make a kind of barrier from the bottom edge of the window frame and to the screens sitting just outside of them. It seemed to help. I had to kill three of the little fuckers before I went to bed, but they might have gotten in before I put the tape-thingie in place. And I only got bitten at the beginning of the night, which is sort of weird because I don’t remember killing any of those creepy vampire things during the night. All I know though is by the end of the night everything was fine. Let’s see how tonight is before I pat myself on the back too much. But I paid off most of my sleep debt from the night before. Which was dragging my ass around the office yesterday afternoon.

After three years in Stanford, he formed Silicon Graphics along with other colleagues at the said university. The company manufactured graphics workstations, which evolved into graphical UNIX workstations equipped with high-speed hardware for graphics rendering. Within a decade, Clark and his co-founders were able to make the company a world leader in 3-D imaging and movie visual effects.

In limited U.S. release for about a month now, Lisa Cholodenko’s The Kids Are All Right is already being touted as a potential awards-season frontrunner. And in a year as bleak for U.S. films as 2010 has thus far proven to be, I wouldn’t really be surprised if this prediction turns out true, especially given some exceedingly solid turns from Annette Bening (who I didn’t know I missed until now - I don’t think I’ve seen her in anything new since American Beauty), Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, and Mia Wasikowska.

Well-known New Orleans chef John Besh has put together an unforgettable collection of Southern recipes that anyone passionate about Southern cooking, or even just curious, should want to read. I like it because they are the staples from my childhood and therefore recipes that I really would eat at home and can prepare on my own, without any special skills or knowledge, as “chefs at home” books often are. It has the corn pudding, two recipes for fried chicken, fried catfish, cheese grits, angel biscuits, drop biscuits, buttermilk pancakes, sloppy joes, baked beans… with a few little ‘inspired’ recipes thrown in for good measure. I would love a paperback version because this bound version is large and heavy (and beautiful). I am biased when it comes to Southern cooking, so I think everyone should have a copy of this.
And what of Lily Grace? The little princess of the house is still the princess. She loves to be cuddled, held like a baby, even though she's 4 going on 10. She has taken on a few characteristics that Lia Faith brought to the table, but I think that's to be expected. She's also begun to do a few things that we're not sure are a result of Lia being here or whether she would have done these things anyway. Little things she knows are wrong, but when asked she says "I couldn't not do it!" Most times, she blames Lia if she fears she stepped over the line!

The material I’ve presented above once again highlights a number of things. First, it illustrates the sloppy “scholarship” of Bob Sungenis. I’m sad to say that in Bob’s writings on neo-geocentrism and certain other topics (such as Jews and Judaism) we’re treated again and again to quotes taken out of context, exaggerations to the point of outright falsehood, misleading analyses, false accusations, double standards, and outright errors of fact.
2. The Location. Hello?! You are standing in a bathroom! “I know the best place to show off my knitting! Bathrooms just scream beautiful, natural and hand crafted!” said nobody, ever. Seriously, wake up and smell the…umm…toilets? Okay, minor rant over. Bathrooms are usually very small (especially in England) which means you will almost always be standing far too close to the mirror (this may also be because you are trying to capture more detail). Shots that are taken close-up, as opposed to shots that are merely zoomed in, often feel quite claustrophobic to the person looking at them. It is hard to focus on certain parts of the knitting, and you naturally try to lean back to remedy this (which doesn’t work). Very few mirrors are ‘perfect’ mirrors, most of them have imperfections which cause House of Mirrors effects; bits of the knitting are stretched out and some are squashed, etc. Having the camera that close to the mirror also has the side effect of making the photo fuzzy and out of focus, which again will lose you detail.

Two repeated phrases reinforce the complexity of Kanye’s sophisticated relationship with himself and those who love and hate him. The first is the refrain, borrowed from King Crimson’s titular song, ’21st Century Schizoid Man’. Like Mersault, who is torn between societal norms and his, albeit largely unexplored, indifference towards the world of human affairs, Kanye is ‘schizoid’, a divided self. The song explores this division as one between the private and the public self, between his natural creativity and the pressures of fame, between his younger more authentic persona and the new one, ostensibly undermined by celebrity. Taken with ‘All of the Lights’, which follows ‘Power’ on the album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and forms with it something of a musical diptych, Kanye laments the extent to which fame has changed him and in doing so has driven his family away.

I found this super cute sweater dress at goodwill and had been putting off getting some leggins until I found some cheap ones. I finally found some for $3 at Walmart (SCORE!) so I decided to break the outfit out for work. I work it with some flat Mary Jane shoes. Cute enough. It was after lunch-ish when Amy and her mom, Lisa said "why dont you try these boots on?" They were cute, black, slouchy leather. And about 2 sizes too big. (nothing that can't be fixed with some of Ed's socks!) I started to protest then said "Sure, Why not?" I loved them. They made me feel awesome. And they completed my outfit!! So you can imagine my heart when she said "You can have them if you want." "Really, I can have them? Are you sure?" It is hard to explain what exactly happened then, but I can only describe it as a new sense of confidence. Since that day, I have found my self getting back to my "roots" so far as trying not to wear the exact same things every day, and even getting a tad more...stylish? than I have been in a good long time.

Since the birth of Noah it has been a rollercoaster ride with Fabio. He has a lovely girlfriend who is more engaged and seems more caring about our son than he is. I get along very well with her and am very happy she is a grounding influence in his life. He is still a distant person in our lives and I don’t think he will ever be a fantastic influence in my son’s life but I am thankful that we can all get along and Noah will know where he came from. He can make his own decisions about the quality of his Father’s parenting when he is old enough. Until then it is my job to facilitate their relationship to the best of my ability. I think it helps that there are no confused emotions there. I think it makes it easier to make decisions that are in Noah’s best interests.

So if you have a few minutes please hope on over to my Etsy shop and take a look around. You might find something you wanted on sale ....... :) Oh, and I'll be adding goodies throughout the next few days so stop on by later as well.

What I have found out is that I actually really enjoy knitting, it’s such a relaxing and almost therapeutic hobby. You can lose your mind in your own thoughts or even attempt to watch TV at the same time. I think it’s the repetitive action, it’s ever so calming. Or maybe that’s why I keep missing my stitches – I need to concentrate more!

The point I find interesting about this article is that they draw a parallel between the expectation of revenue generated by this world wide event (which of course was started in Greece thousands of years ago and continues today) and the venues which popped up over night to meet the demands of the expected influx of tourism for the year 2004 and claim that it was actually the demise of that country’s financial institutions.
admit, Dr. Mohler, that I’m kind of selective on that point of view. I really turn almost exclusively to the teachings of Jesus Christ, who never mentioned homosexuality at all as a sin. He never condemned homosexuals and so I don’t condemn homosexuals. And our church, our little church in Plains, we don’t ask, when people come to join our church, if they’re gay or not. We don’t ordain, we don’t practice marriage between gay couples in our church, but that’s a Baptist privilege of autonomy of local churches. I’m against any sort of government law, either state or national, that would force churches to perform marriage between gay people, but I have no objection to civil ceremonies. And so, I know that Paul condemns homosexuality, as he did some other things like selfishness that everybody’s guilty of, and so I believe that Jesus reached out to people who were outcast, who were condemned, brought them in as equals and I also pretty well rely on Paul’s writing to the Galatians that everyone is equal in the eye’s of God and we’re treated with compassion. And I personally believe, maybe contrary to many of your listeners, that homosexuality is ingrained in a person’s character and is not something they adopt and can abandon at will. So I know that what I’ve just explained to you might be somewhat
The Bible records that sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and death through sin came to all men because all have sinned. (With sin comes not only physical death but death to the eternal soul separated from the presence of God). How much more did God's grace and the gift (eternal life connected back into the presence of God) that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! (Rom. 5: 12-16)
On the other hand, I do not have one single electronic product from Turkey, and yet I love Turkish cuisine (the only thing I have in common with Claudia Roth). And I find the extroverted and noisy Turks more likable than the uncommunicative and quiet Japanese, whose mood you cannot read by looking at them.
The politicians and attorneys would scurry away like cockroaches, scared of the light, and actually afraid of being in power. Only an honest man would take on a public position such as this.

The CCGPF has spent 4 months focusing on compiling the water quality data on upper Namskaket marsh and Hurley's Bog. Independent testing has been conducted for comparison purposes. Individual members of the Orleans' Citizens Peer Review Panel have been providing assistance in interpreting the results from the sources named in their report. To my knowledge this is the very first time that this information on water quality on Namskaket has ever been assembled in one report and disseminated to the public in a layperson format.
Arguably, various characters and scenes have been stereotyped and over-exaggerated but I don’t see this as a negative; it simply forces the audience to become involved and question their own thoughts as well as those of the individual characters. In addition, several moments of blatant comedy are present to intercut the drama and allow the play to breathe.

Historically, those in power have had to objectify others—made into “capital O” Others—before they could exploit them. When I think of the people I knew in this “anti-P.C.” camp, I am generally overcome with disdain and rage, because they are simply a new face doing the same objectification. Their effect on social justice movements is not benign, but a significant part of the problem. Oppression is effectively normalized by their brand of “freedom to” rhetoric, thus duping disenfranchised youth and others who stumble upon this sentiment to buy into the thrills of breaking boundaries instead of realizing their potential to make the world a better place and then plugging into projects and communities of righteousness.
After my illness, I got drunk so infrequently and my hangovers were so horrific that I probably remember every occasion. On one of them, I drove my father for a visit with my sister and her cotton-ginner husband near Tallulah, Louisiana, some hundred miles distant. We three men took a one-night camping trip upon which we mostly drank. When the two of them went back to drinking the next morning, I told my father that I either needed to sober up, or we needed to plan on spending the night at my sister’s. He said we could stay, but when nighttime came, he wanted to go home. I reminded him of his agreement, and he said that, by god, if I wasn’t man enough to drive, he was. When I objected, he set out walking—or at least it looked a little like walking. While my sister and brother-in-law went to fetch him, I prepared as best I could for our drive across the battlefields of the Old South.
Hope everyone is enjoying their summer! I know we all are here. And welcome our new son to the hobby. He's stuck now!! I mean, these he can kind of play with. True, as you can see he still looks at the keys, but COME ON, he's only 7 months old for cripes sakes! The golf clubs he can't use yet. Yet. Golf clubs?

In truth, there’s nothing special about DOOMSDAY that makes me hate you for not liking it, but for me, it hits enough notes that it makes for a good, solid, post-apocalyptic action film. I just bought the Blu ray out of the $8 bin (actually, the $7.88 bin) at Walmart and it’s a slick watch. DOOMSDAY moves fast, hits hard, looks great, and it has Rhona Mitra kicking ass. It doesn’t have the style or narrative strength of something like 28 Days Later, but if you like these post-apocalypse stories like I do, DOOMSDAY delivers.
I am genuinely shocked that there's so little hate mail on this one. Last year Brooklyn's 'The Tablet' had a reader writing a letter to the 'letters to the editor' page for six consecutive weeks talking about how Sen. Kennedy should not have received a Catholic funeral; of course, those readers clearly were more knowledgeable than either of the Bishops in Boston or Washington.

My husband and I did not come into marriage as pure as snow. He has a son with a girl from High School. Dear Step-son (DSS-1) has been part of our lives since 1997. He is 26 and we have known him on a continued basis since he was 13 yr. This child has been through the ringer and then some. He is the father of 2, one boy, 7 yr, and one girl 2 yr. They each have different mothers, DSS-1 has not been married to either of them. We had the pleasure of have the GD here for about 5-6 weeks, she just went back with her parents Monday. Having a 2 yr around again was hectic to say the least. She is so darn cute, though.
To promote 'Be Seeing You' the Feelgoods returned once more to Canvey's Labworth Cafe. They had already taken a series of iconic shots here a few years earlier with Wilko, so perhaps the return marked the final handing over of the baton.... For this shoot, the lads donned Prisoner style jackets (the title of the album had been lifted from a phrase used in the cult TV show).
My prediction is that the Hokies will win over UVA for the 8th straight year but it will be very very close and could come down to the final minutes of the game. Techs special teams will give them the slight edge and the leg of Kicker Cody Jounell will show the country that the Hokies do belong (something that Oregon, Oklahoma State and Alabama failed to do).

Along with the "everyone has to start somewhere" fallacy, the "you have to know someone" myth is one of the most pernicious, because it convinces many writers that it's not even worth trying for commercial publication. Instead of boldly querying the top agents who can get their manuscripts onto the desks of editors at big publishing houses, or going direct to the reputable independent publishers that accept unagented submissions, many writers who buy into this myth confine their queries to amateur or track-recordless agents, or decide to self-publish, or approach only micro-presses. Of course, while hooking up with an amateur agent is never a good move, self- or micro-press publication can be entirely appropriate in the right circumstances. But if you have commercial ambitions, it's probably not the best place to start--especially if you haven't even given the commercial route a chance. You'll never know whether you could have succeeded if you don't try.

I did enjoy clicking through all the scenes to find various magical objects. It would be more rewarding, though, if we could unlock, say, a special Chocolate Frog card after we’d collected all the others. It gives you a reason to find everything. I also wish we could look at what we’ve collected. I don’t mean that J.K. Rowling has to write pages and pages of the magical books that we find. It would be nice, though, if we could read a page or two, or look more closely at our Chocolate Frog cards. I liked reading the extra information about the series that you can unlock, especially the Minerva McGonagall and the Petunia & Vernon Dursley pages. I laughed a lot at the description of Petunia and her fiance (Vernon) meeting Lily Potter and her boyfriend (James). The Dursleys page also explained why the Dursleys take Harry with them to that hut on the rock – they believe the superstition that wizards can’t cross water. I’d always thought they just hoped not to be found there. I was very interested in ‘The Original Forty’ – the original 40 Hogwarts students in Harry’s year, with all sorts of edits to their names and personalities - because I am a writer too (although not a famous one yet!) and I edit my characters quite a bit. Yes, some of the information can be found by looking in the books, but some is new. I can’t wait until they get farther along in the series and we can learn more about the members of the Marauders, the Order of the Phoenix, and the Death Eaters!

So how do I feel about reviews? I’m completely neutral. Other than PW, Kirkus, Fresh Fiction and any newspaper reviews, I pay no attention. On the whole, I get more positive reviews than negative ones, but I always get at least one stupid one per book. The delivery person is my current WTF reviewer. On my last book the person happened to say Fat Chance was terrible and had no chance of surviving as a series. Guess she missed the two books before that and the two books after Fat Chance. Oh, and she made a point of telling people I was no match for Janet Evanovich and she had no idea why Janet had given me a quote. Another WTF moment. Hard to get worked up over ill-informed people who get to hide behind the anonymity provided by the Internet.

But there’s one small problem. Since the book is written by a man and the main character is supposed to be a woman, it lacks that feminine touch. This isn’t something that can be figured out by walking around in women’s clothing. Mi Roo offers to help. He can use Sofia as a model or rather Mi Roo herself. Joon think it’s a great idea but why is Mi Roo being so generous?

Our retail store operates as an authorized beer store by the LCBO, but the regulation around home delivery uses the wording ‘operated' instead of ‘authorized’, which is how it is worded to allow us to sell to special occasion permit holders, and retail customers. It is interesting to note that the Beer Store, which is not operated by the LCBO or government is somehow allowed to sell to home delivery services.

Both Luck and Griffin could be future Pro-Bowlers. Both could be busts. One could succeed and one could fail. It could be anywhere in between. No matter which option it is, it’s not going to be because of anything that any pundit says (including me), and no one knows for sure how or why either will succeed or fail until it actually happens. Until we reach that point, both are excellent choices and you could flip a coin to pick either and be confident that a good pick was made.

Yes, He will! And if you have a job or other sources of income, He already is providing for you! But nowhere in Scripture is His provision for us portrayed as a means to rescue us from our own laziness or foolishness. God has provided me with a wonderful job that I've had for nearly 10 years. But does that mean I can use my money in whatever way I want because "God will provide"? Not at all! A sizable number of Jesus' parables were about stewardship--how we use (or misuse) the resources He allows us to have. Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 3:10-14:

Transgression would also arise if a nation was attacked without first calling them to Islam. Muslims are ordained to call their enemies to Islam before fighting against them. If they refuse, Muslims should call them again to pay Jizya and submit to the laws of Allah (Subhanahu Wa ta’ala). If the enemy refuses again, Muslims should fight them in order that there be no persecution, and the Deen should be for Allah alone. This procedure should be observed, otherwise the limits have been transgressed and, “Allah verily loves not transgressors.”

On my recent excursion to New York City for Fashion Week, I opted for the boots on days I felt heels would be too much of a hassle. To dress up the boots a bit more, I added the Moondance I to the top of my boots as I walked through the tents and around the city. I received so many compliments, with many thinking that the embellishment on the top was part of the boot. I told them it was a brand called The 2 Bandits, which became a conversation starter. The company has so many Bandits to choose from that it will be impossible to ever get bored with the same pair of boots.
So the items that they put inside of the case varies from day to day and changes from morning to night.

Historical Insight:
On April 8, 1991 Steven Staley was found guilty of capital murder. He was subsequently sentenced to death on April 25, 1991. Prior to his conviction, Staley had given a written statement implicating himself in the shooting. Tracey Duke was sentenced to three life sentences in Texas and an additional 30 year sentence in Colorado for murder and armed robbery. Brenda Rayburn, as part of a plea bargain, was sentenced to 30 years.
The Obama administration has asked for grand jury records and court proceedings related to the investigation of the murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry to be sealed, and a federal judge has agreed. We do not know why they have been sealed, as the judge’s decision itself has been sealed. However, this apparently came in the wake of a Washington Times report that the drug smugglers who were involved in the shootout with the Border Patrol were actually on patrol, hunting to kill Border Patrol agents.

The CBI doesn’t provide an analysis of deposits at the covered banks – about the only analysis it doesn’t provide – but in terms of all banks operating in Ireland including foreign and IFSC banks, Irish household deposits fell by €0.4bn in February, the second month in a row to see declines. Household deposits at all banks are now back at August 2011 levels. Total deposits from all sources in all Irish banks fell €14bn in February, mostly as a result of a decline in €12bn in deposits by euro area (non-Irish) depositors.

Hence, there are some incredibly long sequences with nothing but Klingon ships flying in a straight line, Kirk’s shuttle flying towards the Enterprise, and a mind numbing sequence during which the ship flies into V’Ger. All you see are dazzling blue lights and occasional glimpses of the actors’ faces, gazing in awe. They look like they might say something, but they never do. The shortest of these sequences is three and a half minutes. That is three and a half minutes of watching special effects that do nothing to move the story along.
My apologies to all of the Beyonce fans who read my blog who may misunderstand the point of this post. I don't hate Beyonce. But apparently, I am viewed by some as one of "those" parents who strive to deprive my children of all fun and joy in life by not introducing people like Beyonce into their lives. I make no apologies for my positions but realize that music is a touchy subject. Even some very fervent, practicing Catholics have a blind spot in this area... not an ignorance, but an ignoring. Most of us do it in different areas of our lives. Some areas are decidedly more difficult to flesh out, but lyrics and lifestyles that very obviously glorify sin and the objectification of human beings... that seems like a Catholic no-brainer.

It took me a few more decades to get it – but those kids actually had the right idea. So many times in life when we fall down on our race to the finish, we stumble up and stagger along, dragging our now fallen veneer – our potato sack – along with us. We get bumps, scratches and bruises – sometimes we even trip others up along the way. Our failure to fully recover from our falls often causes us to ultimately lose the race. If only we could be more like those kids. They fall, and in that process they recognize what made them fall and learn from it. They shed the potato sack, go back and start again with a fresh outlook and from a new position. They still have the finish line in sight, but they know they don’t need to be the first to get there. They will get there in time, once they get it right.
What about you? Are you abiding in His will? It begins with salvation. From 1 Timothy 2:4, “Who will have all men to be saved.” From then on it is to obey the rightly divided Word of God and walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. (Galatians 5:16)

The movie reached that level just because it keeps surprising you in every moment starting from the beginning when after 10 minutes you realize that you are actually watching a silent movie made in the sets of the year 1927. You feel like teleported to that era. You will really not miss all the talking and the sound because it has been replaced by beautiful jazz music which will make your mood jumpy and refreshing. It’s a movie which will keep you glued to the seat not because of the beautiful romantic story of a super famous silent movie star named George Valentin and a rising movie actress Peppy Miller but due to the surprises and the beautiful flow of the movie which is funny, psychedelic, romantic and refreshing. It’s a beautifully acted movie which portrayed how pride destroyed a silent movie superstar when talkies was introduced to the movie industry and how he misunderstood his lover Peppy Miller who was a talkies superstar who got a break in the movie industry because of George. He was so blinded by his pride that he turned from riches to rags and became a madman. He lost all his friends, his only friend was his pet dog who finally saved his life. The movie proved to the world that only facial expressions and good music can say more than dialogues. I dearly hoped the pet dog of “The Artist” won an Oscar for best supporting actor.

This week, my goal has been to reign myself in again. I want to choose healthy and nutritious foods that are good for both my baby and me. I want to say no to sweets and junk food, which is hard. Just because I am pregnant people think I should be able to eat whatever I want. I believed in this at first, especially for the two months that I was queasy and experiencing morning sickness. What baby wanted, baby got, mostly because nothing else sounded good to eat. However, now that I am feeling so great, I don’t think that means I should eat whatever I want just because I am pregnant.

I almost never want to sit and just relax but when I realize what I’m doing to myself, I remember that it’s ok to disconnect and just relax for a bit.
On Saturday, I hopped on the N-Judah to head downtown to go to a friend's anniversary and housewarming party. Halfway to my destination, a gaggle of loud, crazy young people (I know I sound like I haven't put my dentures in yet, but that's what they were), dressed in what can only be described as an updated version of Summer of Love attire, crammed themselves onto the once quiet train. The girls had the headscarves, flower face paints, long hair and halter tops, but one boy was wearing SquareBob Spongepants pants under his Nesta Bob Marley shirt, one boy was wearing a pirate hat and another a green visor that said Las Vegas on it.
Our attacking display yesterday couldn’t be faulted. Some of the link up play between Welbeck and Rooney was first class, with Rooney’s second goal demonstrating that both players have grown a good understanding of each other and bringing back memories of Yorke & Cole against Barca in 99. Welbeck took his goal very well, a little side step/shimmy just made him enough room to get the shot off allowing him to exquisitely place it into the top corner. Nani’s goal was a well worked piece of play mixing up one and two touch passing with great movement, with Welbeck again playing a huge part in the goal – his excellent first time pass split the defence giving Nani space and time to calmly dink the ball over a sliding Howard. Yesterdays attacking display shown we are capable of finding the back of the net, and that we are dangerous going forward but unfortunately all the good attacking work was let down with poor defending.
After I got used to the flow of the novel — I’m pretty sure I was lost at the term “cryogenically frozen” — I fell into a groove of reading it. The beginning was quite disturbing, but it sucked me in nonetheless. After that, I could not put this book down, for the life of me. I think one thing that I enjoyed was that this was a dystopian that didn’t take place on a transformed and beaten-to-death Earth — it was refreshing to read one that took place on a space craft, even if that makes the reader feel the same claustrophobia as the characters.

People began herding their livestock between the two fires as young men jumped through the lowering flames, casting dried sedge and heather into the hungry flames. The cattle were blindfolded and pulled between the double fires. After which the sheep were herded through with the help of many men and a couple of dogs. Bran nipped merrily at the heels of every sheep possible, thoroughly enjoying his work! Next came the horses. All of them had to have dark cloth tied about their eyes and cajoled through with reins. All except the O’Neill’s horses. The three horses, Brodie first, Sammy next, and Emma last walked unaccompanied yet confidently between fires.

The inquiry into the sinking of Titanic put the official number of fatalities at 1,517. The book that my daughter and I read at the library broke the numbers down by first, second, and third class passengers, as well as crew members. Since Davenport was not on the boat, and did not meet his fate in the icy North Atlantic, he was not counted among that number. However, the sinking of the ship led to his demise, since without it he would not have been exposed to the elements while waiting for Carpathia to arrive in New York.
So, imagine my delight when I discovered The Glossy Box… one of the girls in the office walked into my office with a little Harrods box all wrapped up and she handed it to me. With a huge smile on my face and a few shrieks of joy I opened it, photographed it and opened it some more. At this stage two others had come into my office to see what all the panic was over!
In unrelated news, I’ve been working on a small SHMUP-like video game for the past few weeks and I decided to throw together a quick demo video for it. I couldn’t find my Adobe Premiere CD, so I had an interesting time just trying to sync things up in Windows Movie Maker. Still, I had more luck with WMM than with Camtasia Studio (which I find terrible), so I can’t hate on it too much.
I also bought another pair of socks and some sole inserts that support my very high arch. (Another reason I suffer shin splints…)

For the birds, there's really minimal prep other than the dry rub. Pull out the giblets, rinse em off in cool water, pat them dry with a towel (the chickens, I don't care what you do with the giblets). The only extra step I recommend before applying the rub is to peel a bunch of cloves of garlic, and insert them under the skin of the bird over all the best pieces of meat. I put a couple over each breast, as well as some in the thigh and drum areas. Once the chickens are looking nice and lumpy, apply a nice thin coating of peanut oil all over the inside and outside of the chicken. It will give it a delicious golden skin, and it lets the dry rub stick. Now that you've greased up your bird, you're going to want to apply the rub. Don't roll the chickens in it. It will be way too much. Apply a bit here and there and just rub it in, making sure not to miss any nooks or crannies. Do the inside surfaces of the bird too, if for no other reason, then because it's fun to wear your food like a puppet once in a while. After this step, wrap the chicken(s) in saran wrap or tightly seal in a ziplock with the air pushed out. Refrigerate for at least an hour or two to get the flavor to penetrate.
No, you are a living relic. It is my prayer this week, as you read about how the church assembled the sacred Scriptures, about those who contended for the faith, and those who died for it, that you will take comfort in this notion. And remember that your job is to make more relics just like you.

I believe there are a number of areas that the TTC (or, as stated, other transit authorities) could fix towards having a better rider experience and superior consumer engagement. In the first four posts there were ideas on signage and wayfinding, of expanding the colour-code system and of totally utilizing myriad digital delivery methods.
The ransoms the large shipping companies are willing to pay to secure the release of their vessels and crews totals tens of millions of dollars, money that most certainly is used to further perpetuate piracy, secure weapons and ammunition, fast boats, GPS, satellite radios and so on. This in itself merely encourages the pirates. Besides, how much of this money is passed on to radical terrorist groups?

YOU OFTEN HEAR the view expressed that “I’m not surprised that pub X has closed. It had gone really downhill – it had stopped serving real ale and opening at lunchtimes, and seemed to appeal mainly to deadlegs. They ended up putting strippers on to try to attract custom.” Now, that may well explain why Pub X has closed instead of Pub Y, but very often such measures are a symptom of falling sales rather than a cause. Pubs often seem to get into a spiral of decline from which it is difficult to escape.

I don't know if it is pinterest overload or what, but these roller shades just aren't doing it for me in the kitchen. While I am happy that this little project inspired literally thousands of people (and by the way, I wasn't the first one to do this), I am ready to move on. This is the good thing about not spending a lot on home improvements. If you change your mind, ahem, then the cost is minimal to shift gears later.
I'm finally getting to share some pics from the Illinois Reading Council Conference in Springfield, IL, last week! First, it was AMAZING. Like, amazing amazing. I couldn't believe how huge it was. They were using meeting rooms throughout two big hotels and then also the convention center for exhibitors to set up. And then people still stayed at even further hotels and were bussed over. I heard there were about 3000 kindergarten through college English teachers there. So cool!

This is an area of Kuechly’s game that is hard to grade not because he can’t blitz but just because he wasn’t asked to do this all too often at Boston College. Kuechly does lack some athleticism and his closing burst is just average at this point. However, Kuechly does do a good job of making plays behind the line of scrimmage and knows how to shoot gaps. It will be interesting to see how or if Kuechly will be used as a pass rusher, which my guess would be not. His main strengths include helping out in the run and pass game, however he is a much better coverage player than true threat to get after the quarterback. Kuechly probably wont make too many sacks in his career but he shows above average awareness, instincts, and hustle which should allow him to make some splash plays behind the line of scrimmage from time to time.

Mary's life in the village is predictable. The Sisterhood, the Guardians, and the Guild keep the secrets and protect the village. People follow the rules, whether it's staying away from the Fence or marrying the person you should, not the person you want. When Mary loses her parents and her family, she begins to ask questions and to want more than to love or be loved. Before she can figure out the answers, the Unconsecrated threaten to overrun the village.

I know I should talk about what is going on with Bear right now. I want to but to tell you the truth, I find the thought of it purely exhausting. For nine years now it has been exhausting. Story simplified-I haven’t seen Bear in three weeks, Dustin hasn’t seen her in 4. My Uncle (who has custody) doesn’t like to deal with things and is telling us that Bear says she would like to spend more time with her bio Mom than us. Which we call bullshit on but welcome to the world where we honestly have no say. It is more convenient for him to use her Bio Mom and give in to her than anything else.

The city of Norfolk, Va., is getting an early look at what sea-level rise means for a big coastal community. The city is experiencing sea-level rise earlier than most because not only are the seas around the city going up, but much of the land beneath Norfolk is going down. This one-two punch means the city is seeing today the kind of flooding that many cities could experience down the road if the scientific projections of sea-level rise play out.

Although a comic novel there’s a darkness beneath it especially with menacing figures like Carl, how much of this came from your own experience of school days and the adolescent ‘jungle’? I went to secondary school in the 1990s, which though it wasn’t that long ago chronologically feels, from this vantage, almost prehistoric. So many interesting things have happened since then – the internet, the war on terror, mobile phones, X-Factor – and I wanted to write about those things. For all their supposed privilege, I think in some ways the kids in Skippy have a harder time than my generation did. Their world is so much more mediated, the forces of capitalism have a much tighter stranglehold on them so they have even more impossible expectations to try and fail to live up to. Compared to now, my time in school was quite benign. Certainly, it was a jungle, and there were large, terrifying creatures with BO lurking around every corner. But if you were fast, you could outrun them. How can you outrun Facebook?

I was feeling ambitious and attempted one of the most traditional closed tart design. This entails wrapping the jam with the dough and shaping it into an acorn shape before making little snips around the tart to achieve the semblance of a little pineapple. The whole process of shaping and snipping was so laborious that I only managed to get some 20 tarts in close to an hour. I gave up and chose a simpler shaping method which only required me to roll the round dough across a little ribbed plastic panel.
My oh my, how I do love this! The uncooked tomato and olive oil give this a cool, flavorful and salad-y feel, but the quinoa and lentils stay warm enough to make it feel hearty and comforting. Beef, pork, chicken, fish – this would go great on the side of any main protein, and it’s so easy to adjust your spices to go along with whatever else you’re cooking. You could even omit the spices and cook it in chicken broth for flavor. Yummy! This recipe is fun to play around with using different grains and legumes, so try whatever is taking up space in your pantry!

One summer afternoon, I’d made my usual pilgrimage to Morgan Self Books to get some more back issues of comics. Typically, I’d browse through the bins, pick out a few, add them up and see if I had any extra cash to maybe pick up a paperback or two. This time, I did. And there was this book at sort of intrigued me, primarily because it only had a painting of a woman’s face on the cover. No title, no author. Only the words, “A novel of a girl possessed of a terrifying power.” I’d never seen that before.
With Italian cinema (arguably) all but dead, how much hope do you have that we will ever see a full resurgence of these types of films coming out of Europe? Or will it just be a case of their influence being felt in the work of a new generation of filmmakers such as yourself?

There’s no escaping it, this bizarre reaction does raise some rather eerie questions, such as are these individual suffering from some form of a psychosis or have they simply just been so thoroughly indoctrinated by the Norwegian consensus apparatus that they are incapable of displaying anything else than the preordained and sanctioned emotions authorized by the authorities?

One local man - Michael Forbes - has stood up to Trump from day one and refuses to budge from what has been his family home for decades. Trump's plans for his hotel have been thwarted thus far and his on-going and very public battle with Mr Forbes has seen Trump describe him as 'the village idiot'. Whatever your view on Mr Forbes, one can't but help admire him for standing up to Trump and just not letting him get his own way.
I happen to believe that an individual’s childhood and teenage years will always have a huge impact on the person that they become and the adult life that they lead. So if those years were crap for any reason (abuse and permanent injuries being the most extreme examples), then there is a lot for that person to overcome in their quest for lifetime happiness and achievement.

If the previous picture showed the noble side of the DBR sporting player explaining 'how he died' the next picture shows the fictional "billimeter" nonsense that DBR (or any) rules can degenerate into. Any loss from the Rolyalist command now means "the end of their right wing", so when the little red horsemen (see below bottom left quarter) suffered a recoil from the shooting from Parliamentarian pistol and light artillery it should have been "Goodnight Vienna" as it recoiled into friends/enemies facing the wrong way, but the Royalist player invoked the "blind billimeter DBR defense". Groan ... my head started swimming.
I had the most extraordinary encounter today that it would seem prudent to relate it here, despite my objections to anecdotes on principle, as they are by nature frivolous affair and any overindulgence in their practice leads, unerringly, towards moral degradation and an intolerable erosion of one’s natural dignity. Nevertheless, as I say, this particular encounter was noteworthy enough to be recorded for posterity, as I should like to recall it perhaps at some date in the distant future, and do not find it prudent to rely exclusively upon memory. Therefore, I have decided to forego the usual financial narratives that hitherto have occupied these pages in favor of a tale somewhat more dramatic in nature.

2010, you revealed my weaknesses by slapping me in the face. Very public failures that led to sleepless nights that led to wildly aggressive, mildly productive days that led to more sleepless nights that somehow led me to a logical idea of how to proceed in the most efficient way. You took my dangerous overconfidence and stripped it down to it's core; an inflated ego resting on a wobbly scaffolding made up of too many compliments, too few challenges, and the idea that I could do anything, at any time. 2010, at a certain point you were beating me down in such a brutal way that you made me feel deeply connected to the world around me. Turmoil, frailty, unrest, rage. You forced me to find a way to escape myself if only through running until my legs cramped and my lungs ached, and I was far, far away, with no choice but to walk back home alone, insecurities and fears taunting me the whole way.

In the past the push for bypasses came from two directions: the shippers and travelers who didn't want to be slowed down, and the neighbors who didn't want traffic. But the reason the neighbors didn't want traffic was because the traffic was dangerous, noisy and polluting. Cities like Detroit and neighborhoods like Bronzeville will never come back until through traffic can cross them at a safe, human scale.

Meanwhile, Liz finds her own escape. Her decisions create the uncertainty that she and Jimmy must deal with, if not solve, as the novel reaches its satisfying, open-ended conclusion.

We should also beware of comparing ourselves to Jesus – He is perfect, and so we may lose heart instead of resonating with God’s heart! Saul was in many ways the antithesis of Jesus, more a shadow of Saul of Tarsis before his conversion, a man who had to prove God even when God needed no proof. Yet, when David lamented the death of his enemy Saul, he was the man after God’s heart, making Saul’s sin seem little and God’s grace overwhelming.
Previous to the Listerine advertising, bad breath had been understood as a disagreeable social habit, but because people can’t really smell their own breath, ‘getting rid of my bad breath’ had not been a task they actively sought to fulfill. Before Listerine sold mouthwash, they sold halitosis.
As part of the first phase of implementation, certain sections of the act came into effect on December 13 and January 16.
Maybe this reaction was something specific to me? If so, it might happen again! I guess I looked worried as don Rober approached me and asked if I was “bien?” I assured him I was fine and he smiled and patted my back. Other participants also came up to me and gave me their love and encouragement. This is such an affirming and responsive group experience. It is reassuring and powerful.

My day started off as normal, Cam Man was excited to see me and we toodled off down the road to the Farmer’s. Although, today we did stop to do a little learning. I wish I had my camera with me, because we stopped at the side of the road and Cam-Man had his first encounter with a cow. Yes, folks, I stopped and got Cam-Man out of the car because some of the cows were up against the fence, along with a calf. We walked up to them and the Momma cow was eyeballing us.

What was your favorite subject as a child?
I'm always amused by the uniform I see in Bangkok, which shifts with each visit. This visit, I could not stop seeing scallop-edged tap shorts with blouses tucked in, amongst the long dresses and skirts I saw late last year. At Chatuchak Market, where I spent a good part of Saturday, I saw vintage silk button-down blouses over and over again, all with their sleeves rolled up, which made me think of this uniform.

There is no widespread benefit from mass immigration, it is a vehicle for change that's all was intended for. But of a change which only brings destruction, and the only purpose of which is to replace what was already there, nothing more.
I dont have anything bad to say about it except Topps quality control! A number of the base cards had dings in the lower left corner. You can see it on the Youkilis above. Weirdly the damaged cards weren't in sequence. I would get one from one pack and maybe three in another. Still at least none were creased or scratched up.

So since I'm an ego-maniacal ego maniac with a big ego, here's what's going to happen. I'm going to ramble on for about 4,000 words of absolutely nothing and you guys are going to ooh and ahh and tell me I'm funny and brilliant and the best writer Evah! And if you really can't do that because this is so egregious you may comment on how pretty and shiny my hair is.
Each tenants and merchants need to be clear concerning the agreement they draft prior to they take this agreement. No Deposit Home offers pros and cons with regard to each side. Retailers who’ve currently obtained a house will have respite from having to pay 2 mortgages at the same time, and in a pokey housing industry with lots of properties for sale, this can be their utmost option. Clients that cannot however pay for a house might be able to obtain one more quickly.
Surely not, no... My whole life has been wedded to the physicality of books and their shelves, the way they sat beside my bed on the little white bookcase my parents bought me, or on the planks and bricks I set up in my first-ever flat; the way, on my many moves, I'd pack them carefully into tea-chests before anything else... What would I be without them?

I’ve found that some of the best advice I’ve ever received is often found in a meaningful line of text or by way of an unexpected introduction to a simple concept that I come across, here or there, perhaps via a blog or article, and it sticks with me. It’s those seemingly small, but inspirational thoughts that I can immediately draw upon and begin to implement in my life.

Bookmarked will be back in just under two weeks, time really flies, on Monday the 3rd of October for a Victorian themed evening (with two of my favourite books of 2011 and their authors) of ‘Sensational Stories’ as Jane Harris will be discussing ‘Gillespie and I’ and Carol Birch will be talking about ‘Jamrach’s Menagerie’, as well as all things Victoriana based, to say I am excited would be an understatement. I hope to see you there (if not I will report back again)!
If you're at a buffet, fill up on salad and fruit first, and then lean protein (shrimp, fish, baked/grilled chicken) before making your way over to the pasta station. Think of carbs as a desert, not the main dish. You're eating fruits and veggies for dinner, but you get a few bites of pasta as a desert. I gaurantee you'll eat considerably less of the bad stuff if you make an effort to fill up on good stuff first.

Here are a couple areas I could see them disagreeing.
We ran and hiked, Chris running ahead, then waiting as Jess and I caught up, then running some more, through the now muddy trail as the snow started falling harder, covering what must have been amazing views into the canyon with a thick white snow-fog. I struggled with footing, sliding around if I tried to run and slipping backward when I hiked uphill. I put my head down and focused on moving forward, ignoring the snow, and slipping in my headphones. For about three hours I listened to podcasts (a mix of running from Ultra Runner Podcast and Endurance Planet, comedy from Mark Marron and both from the 3 Non Joggers). It helped pass the time and take my mind off the conditions of the trail. We stopped to fill water at a natural spring on the West Rim Trail and I took my gloves off, dipping my bottle and my fingers into the icy spring. It would be another hour before I could feel them again.
For somebody who has seen and done so much his childlike enthusiasm and unerring excitement for the things he loves is reassuring and a testament that time needn't replace passion with nonchalance. Ella's descriptions of him rushing around his studio, pulling rubber ducks, train sets and other notable knick-knacks from cupboards to share with them instead of dedicating his time to spieling about his new fragrance (the real reason for the meeting) really stayed with me. Ever since I've been pondering the feasibility of asking him to be my dad/confidante/uncle/mentor just so that I can be on the receiving end of such a jolly stream of wisdom and damn right coolness.

There are other things, too. Weird questions keep popping up. Do we live near a church, for instance. I’ve never come across that one before, but apparently some poor souls inherited a house and found themselves with a vast bill for repairing the nave of the local church. Does anyone have rights to the trees, or the wildlife? And don’t ask me about radon gas.

From start to finish prep time on this food gem takes less time than changing your little one's diaper. That is unless you are unfortunate enough to have a tumbler on your hands like I do. This child of mine, now just shy of sixteen months, hates to have his diaper changed. The only thing that manages to make this required activity bearable is allowing him to play with "something" while I am in the mist of the dirty transaction. This "something" has ranged from a toy of his, my cell phone, a dog toy or whatever is within arms reach. I rarely discriminate on the choice of this "something". I mean how much damage could actually be caused in a few mere seconds of hands on activity with a baby powder container from the nearby diaper bag? Okay, actually a lot of damage. On to the actual recipe...
I also love it because on the one hand, there’s this very Victorian sincere quality from which it’s so easy to take the piss; and on the other there’s this tremendous sense of democracy about it. A genuine interest in people and making sure that what they do doesn’t fall between the cracks.

A lot of people don’t understand the Penn State mentality and I don’t 100 percent get it either. I’m not a PSU fan. Never have been and never will be. My disgust for Penn State is borderline hate (but my grandmother taught me when I was little to never hate anyone. I bet your nana taught you that too). I think there’s some kind of brainwashing that goes on at freshman orientation, kind of like in the movie “Disturbing Behavior.” I’m kidding of course. Or am I? At the same time that I don’t get it, I do. Penn State is Joe Paterno and football. They go together like bread and butter. He’s been around for almost half of the schools existence (not really, but close) and he’s turned the institution into a huge place, just because of football. To Staters, Joe Pa and football are the be all end all. They can do anything and it’s okay because the football program makes the school a ton of money, wins, and brings national recognition that PSU is a “cool” place to go. I use cool in quotes because have any of you been to State College? It’s not that cool. Without PSU, State College is just another sleepy town in Pennsyltucky. Tucked along 322 and 80. Students, alumni and fan boys hold Paterno and the whole football program to this inappropriately high standard. They’re god-like and all the little blue and white sheeple have this massive ego like they’re allowed to be these snobby, elitist kids because PSU is the most awesome thing ever (You’d think they went to Yale or something). Side note: at the trustee presser, I wanted to punch the student reporters and students in general in the face. The media didn’t bring this problem to Sad Valley. The offenders/cover uppers did. Okay, moving on…Then you go outside of the State College/central PA bubble people aren’t as in your face about their love for Penn State. It’s literally like a cult, but in this cult they’re all amped up on school spirit and are ready to roid rage at any second. I love my alma matter a lot, but it doesn’t mean I need to act like an asshole about it all the time. Didn’t anyone ever hear about false idols? How about the cult of personality? It’s a pretty good song by Living Colour. No, not the TV show where JLo was a fly girl.
The light changed and cars stopped. Some of them picked up bricks and started chucking them at the cars, and smashed the back window on a Golf. The car in front of the Golf, from what I could see, just drove off.
You may also realize that your outline should be more or less detailed. Making a second or third outline is absolutely wonderful for this editing method. It allows you to base re-structuring on whatever components you see fit (ideas, evidence, plot, character introduction). Best of all, this type of editing, while time consuming, is also very fun and exciting. With this editing method, you can literally see a dead work of writing come to life.

If Day 1 is any indication, spring break in Cancun is going to be a pretty memorable one. I was prepared for crowds and chaos at this time of the year. Instead, The Royal Beach Club at The Westin Spa and Resort in Cancun has been perfect. The beach is absolutely beautiful, our rooms are large and comfortable and the staff has been terrific. I've witnessed more than a few front desk employees sigh as our group of four tired, cranky kids walk into their hotel lobby. Here at the Westin, my children have been welcomed with open arms. During check-in the staff couldn't have been more accommodating and even moved our rooms when they realized they weren't next to each other.

Okada men do this every day, that is, they show their well honed idiocy every day as they get on those bikes and weave through traffic without care or any concern in the world. I slammed on my breaks and cringed at the thought of what or who I may have just run over. People began to gather. And like a swarm of bees, okada after okada after okada began to stop and park and join in what was steadily becoming a circus act, no one even bothered to pay any attention to the lifeless body wedged somewhere between my rear and front tyres!

Pairing Lessons: When in doubt, reach for a Vienna Lager. It goes with most anything, provided the food isn't too imbalanced. For pairing a pumpkin beer, remember to think of all aspects of the beer and don't just assume it's pumpkin pie in a bottle. Most pumpkin beers have real pumpkin in them, which means that should always be in mind when selecting a food pairing. The spices, while probably the most prominent thing in the beer, should be balanced through the food, while the pumpkin should be coaxed forward. Dry-hopping atypical beer styles (things that aren't IPAs, Pales, Ambers, etc) can lend the same effects of cutting through fats and other heavy flavors as their hoppy-tasting counterparts, but without the same amount of hop flavor. Chocolate doesn't have to be relegated to dessert, just ask the Sicilians. Sometimes if you feel a flavor is missing in a beer, you can make up for it by providing that flavor through food. Your tongue won't know the difference.

Happy New Year to all readers of the Marco On The Bass blog! While 2011 was a stressful year for most people (continued job losses, mounting unemployment rates, continued home foreclosures) it's going to be very hard to top when it comes to ska. There was an unbelievable cornucopia of 2-Tone era band tours, shows, books, media coverage and new albums and music to enjoy. In fact, the amount of ska related developments came so fast and furious at times, it was hard to keep up because there was so much to write about. So in that time honored tradition of looking back at the year that was, here is my totally subjective, top 11 Marco On The Bass ska highlights countdown of 2011.

I think this is part of it – I have spent a lifetime building up my YES team. Everyone needs a YES team. They’re the people who when you say, “Am I good enough?” – the answer is always YES. For them it is a no-brainer. They think your question is preposterous and that is exactly why they belong on your YES team.

So, yes, we've been stripping floors, walls, scrubbing, painting, you name it, this place got it and is continuing to get it. I hope I can finish everything by Sunday but if not, there's always Monday! Coriander Dad has been working overtime to help make this place a little gem. My husband('good enough to spread on a cracker' guy) has also been bustin' it to get everything ready and me, well, let's just say that on Sunday I plan to drink a lot. That's not true, I can't drink too much as it puts me to sleep! What fun is that?!! Anyway, I'm going to celebrate my pants off, I'll keep them on but you know what I mean, wow, this is a crazy blog, I'm tired and slightly delirious! So, look at a few pics of the work we've been doing and when you come on Sunday you can see the finished space. Don't judge me if you see an unfinished something, like the entire back room!

Sunday, early afternoon, we were able to check into the Disney Boardwalk Resort with Stampin' Up! After checking in we went exploring the Boardwalk and then the kids were itching to get into the pool. As you can see Jordan found her pen pal, Alexis Van Diepen, at the pool. While the kids were in the pool I headed to the Hospitality Desk to spin the wheel for the first time. We got a very nice MDS Journal and Stampin' Up! made the kids these awesome MDS Swatch Books in their own carrying case so they can get character autographs at Disney. How sweet are they!!!??!!! I will show you pictures of all these awesome gifts in another post.
On Saturday (November 12th) it was my husbands and my 6th Anniversary. For the 6th year we headed to Niagara-On-The-Lake and Niagara Falls for the weekend. We visited many wineries and tasted some amazing wines in both 20 Valley and in Niagara-On-The-Lake - came home with 11 yummy bottles of reds, mostly from the 2007 season as that was the best year for grapes.

Certain (ahem) frightening qualities
That’s when the shrieking began. Emma was MORTIFIED. Her right pant leg was soaked, all up her sweatshirt and sadly, some even got on her hand. Basically the end of the world to her. She screamed, “Thanks a lot Ben!” And then just started to sob uncontrollably. This made Katie cry, I was yelling at Ben, and Dave was….laughing (it must be his coping mechanism). Ben crawled back up in his seat and just watched the chaos unfold. Apparently he felt a lot better. Once I got as much cleaned up as I could, and Emma’s sobs got a little quieter, Dave said, “What were you doing Ben? What happened???” Ben said, “I started to go and then I think the wind just flew my pee everywhere. Sorry.” Ummmm…really?? I was still in shock. “Ben, there’s no wind, we’re in THE CAR!” He just shrugged and said, “Well, it’s really hard to go potty into a cup when your bumping around on the road.”

It was awesome! Adrenaline rush was pumping all throughout the show. Since I like clothes, It was so cool to be surrounded withKermit (not the frog.

It was not just their clothes present in the room, we are actually inside one room, breathing the same air. (OA!)

Whether it’s due to caffeine or just plain genetics, nannies are FULL of energy! When it comes down to it, we are known as “the biggest kid.” we play and run around with the little ones but also maintain our respect. We lead by example and play a significant role in how a child is raised. I must add however, that we do not replace mommy or daddy, but instead are that “extra pair of hands” that only enhance and help the parents out when needed. Parents want to come home and bond with their children and during the day time most parents are away at work which doesn’t leave much time for errand running. We create a balance for parents so that their time with their children is special and not full of mommy in the kitchen or the laundry room. I could ramble on and on about a nanny, but im pretty sure I gave a clear idea. But if you are still curious, or would just simply like to add a comment, please..DO SO!
The thing that I have gained most from this experience is that we are all so different, yet so alike. We all struggle, we all rejoice. And having this community of moms to celebrate motherhood has also, I hope, created an additional support system to other moms. We can share our successes and our failures together because we know what it's like.

Arizona’s answer to the sakura is the Palo Verde (green tree). These trees are all over AZ, and usually they aren’t much to see. However, for a few brief months in the Spring, these trees light up with bright yellow flowers. Usually, the palo verde is mixed in with other desert trees, and you will see these swarms of yellow amidst a sea of green. And if you’re lucky, you’ll see a whole bunch of palo verde trees grouped together, and it turns into a sea of yellow.

My OB came in about an hour later and broke my waters. There was no warning beforehand, there was no discussing it. He just did it. He then put Pitocin in my IV. Again, no warning, no discussion, he just put it in and didn't even tell me what he was doing until he was doing it. He cranked it up to make my labor go faster.
Mr4 likes the music loud when he is in the car. He likes the window down and the breeze in his hair. He tells me that he will be a much better driver than me. Apparently he will be 'fast' and will not hit the gutter when he attempts to reverse park. Everyone's a critic.

The goras on the panel were a refreshing change I must say. Much better at answering the questions at hand, and Anatol Lievin in particular was very practical about his responses. He talked about the potential in Pakistan, but also about the challenges that lay ahead - something the others missed completely. The one thing all goras brought up that was echoed by our beloved Pakistani panelists was the level of philanthropy in in the country, and how it was unrivaled anywhere in the world. I strongly agree with this point, as Pakistanis as a people have very open hearts, and are always willing to give to a good cause, even the middle income folks struggling to cope with rampant inflation in the country. The problem is a lot of this money is misdirected. If we can better utilize this trait of Pakistani, perhaps get the nation to believe in a system where tax goes to development rather than lining the pockets of the corrupt, we could have something. It was nice to hear though people with experience from all over the world, singling out the philanthropy of Pakistanis as something that inspires them.
Before they got too far into removing coats and settling in. I asked if they were sure they wanted to do this tonight. Santa hadn't come yet, the food could easily be wrapped up and saved for the next day, we could just postpone. I think Ratchlet was a bit tempted (she was worried about leaving the dog), but M-t-G was dead set against leaving. "But it's Christmas!" she wailed (after all, she's only 9.) TA said, "It's just a sore throat." (He's not 9, but he is a guy! They tough it out!) So the consensus was on with the show! Oh Goodie!!
We analyze the alternatives. What else can go wrong?
However, after two drinks I said my farewells to work colleagues and headed home, with no desire at all to have any more to drink. It was exactly what I have always wished I could do, and it felt amazing.
Another necessary part of actually constructing a house hold for hens to live in is exactly what substances you will need to create this house. Among the advantages of chicken coops would be the fact they are often constructed from just about anything. For example, you may use; wood, Pvc pipes, tarps along with kits.
Next I made another pillow to match the gingham underneath and added a white lace trim. I think it came from a parcel from a blogger but I'm sorry I can't remember who but thank you! Hope you like the two together.
In this day and age, one would be hard-pressed to find a family that isn’t, in some way, touched by the presence of a blended family. I, myself, grew up with a stepfather, and briefly, a stepmother. Technically, I have one full brother, and 3 half-siblings.
After I realized that this was going to become a habit, I stuck some felt furniture pads on the bottom so it wouldn't scuff the floor as she was dragging it.
The subsequent films in the series were not quite so complex in their social commentary. Each generally dwelt only on one big theme that was introduced in POTA, so i am going to save further analysis for the appropriate film. Tomorrow, I will talk about my favorite of the series, Beneath the Planet of the Apes with its cynical view of religion and the value of humanity.

As an expat, there is one thing that cannot be taught, at least not to me, and that is the zen like patience required when dealing with a culture that views time as merely a concept. Clocks seem unnecessary for the locals and watches are seldom worn. Heck, if not for the frequent holidays here in Mexico they might as well throw out their calendars as well. It is part of the charm here when you have nothing to do as well. However, when time is of the essence, to say that this is stressful would be an over simplification. I wish to remain a free woman. I say this because, yes, I am at that point where I understand how people might snap. In fact, I may have snapped already.
3. Other things not to do on airplane: drugs. All around bad idea. You have no idea what could happen. What if your drug fumes accidentally seep into the pilot’s cabin and they get high and crash the plane? Then there would be trouble. Or, what if you started to act crazy? And the air marshall came out? That would not be a good time.
Also “cruelly hacked” was Santina, the prophet’s wife and Jeanne (eight years old) Angelia (nine) Margaret (ten) and the three-year old son Mario. One account puts Mario’s age at eighteen months. In addition to the prophet’s head, one of the girl’s arms was severed. Police suspected that wound was the result of a “miscalculated blow” intended for Santina’s neck, as it too had been hacked but the head was left hanging by a thread. Leaving the house on St. Aubin avenue, in the Italian district of depression era Detroit, the fiend and pervert left a bloody trail for police which went nowhere.
Voilà, Butterfly Lucy fully colored! Please feel free to ask if you have any questions, I'll do my best to reply ASAP!

In THE BIBLE, a 775,000-word historical fiction/religious memoir, God is the Creator – He from whom all things flow. His creations are uppity things: some of them turn His name into a curse word, some set up false idols in His place, and some eat food He specifically told them was His. One thing’s for sure, God isn’t letting these ungrateful bastards into Heaven until they're redeemed in His eyes.
Ours is a house of nicknames. I knew it to be so when I was contemplating getting an Uberkate Circle necklace and my first two choices of names for each of my boys was not the name they were given at birth. True story. I had two nicknames each lined up before their actual Christian names. And I had not even depleted my supply of nicknames. I could have added at least one more each to the list.

Another groaner comes when Roo tells CJ that sleeping with Zach “was a mistake” for CJ to retort “so was Rockstar: INXS.” Zing? What’s the next incredibly current pop-culture reference you got lying around? Is it a Big Brother gag? How about a Country Practice quip? When Laid isn’t making incredibly dated references to shows nobody remembers it’s also taking snide potshots at obvious targets like Two & A Half Men, Daryl Somers, Twilight and Robin Williams. As if the audience for a dark comedy on the ABC is really going to think it’s terribly original to mock giant punching bags like that.

I hope you’re having a great week. I know a lot are enjoying spring break. I’m looking forward to the upcoming Easter weekend. Carlin’s parents will be here on Friday on their way back from Florida (they are becoming snow-birds). Then on Sunday, we will celebrate Christ’s resurrection by attending church and having brunch with my family.

As I’ve always said to my children and some of the sisters-in-Islam …. our life is like a jigsaw, as much as we women know its “wajib” (compulsory) to put on the headscarf till below our chest to protect our modesty, its also wajib for us to perform the 5 daily prayers, to fast, to do good deeds, to have good heart and characters, to be filial piety to our parents, to respect the elderly and other mankind. So putting on the headscarf is just one corner or portion of the jigsaw …. something which I know can easily be achievable if only we submit totally to Allah’s command without much fuss compared to the other “wajibs” especially the daily prayers.
Though I sometimes try to organize my collection, several of the books have apparently become migratory over the years. For the life of me, I can’t explain how Jeffry Eugenides’ Middlesex ended up next to Retired Racing Greyhounds For Dummies.

Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in 1968 when I was 20 years old. To say that he defined social justice in my formative years would be an understatement. And yet, as much as I admired his fiery and charismatic rhetoric and his brilliant mind, he was never the leader I wanted to follow. HIs personality and perhaps his religion were too different from mine, at least his public personna, we were not, obviously BFFs.
Her rendition of the legendary characters was priceless: The Seven Dwarfs looked like a cross between E.C. Segar’s Jeep and a pack of hairless possums. Even Snow White looked kind of out of it in these pieces; the exhibit had a nightmarish, otherworldly quality. The Prince who saves Snow White is rendered by Garcia as some kind of bizarre-looking gigolo. I liked the part where she’s poisoned in her bed with her name written on it like some kind of coffin.
428. V. Purgatorio, xxvi. 148.
As has been mentioned, however, Mussolini's nationalism is undoubtedly the major feature of Fascist ideology that gets it labelled as Rightist. Nationalism is most easily associated with the Right because it is antithetical to the "equality" gospel that characterizes most Leftism. If all men are equal, then all nations should be equal too. And Mussolini's nationalism did endear him to the Right and gain their co-operation and support on many important occasions. His nationalism also made him eventually reject the divisive "class-war" notions of Communism and the revolutionary activities of the "Reds". He wanted a harmonious and united Italy for all Italians of all classes and was sure that achieving just treatment for the workers needed neither revolution nor any kind of artificially enforced equality.
“This is because some of the nation’s religious scholars – and we do not underestimate them, for they are good people… But due to a certain confusion, they had dissenting views on the martyrdom operations, and this caused us great embarrassment. However, in his unequivocal fatwa, the sheikh, may Allah reward him, considered martyrdom operations to be the most noble level of jihad. That was unparalleled support for the people of Palestine, because, brothers and sisters, you cannot imagine how difficult it is psychologically for a young Palestinian man or woman to sacrifice themselves or what is most dear to them, only to encounter a conflict in their minds and hearts as to whether they are on the path of righteousness, or whether they are committing a religious violation.”

Whipwhirls are a form of elemental conjured into the prime material plane from the elemental planes. At first glance, whipwhirls appear as harmless lengths of white cotton cloth ranging from 5-25’ in length. They are, however, semi-intelligent and, though quite weak individually, are capable of a number of disabling attacks.
My health declined rather quickly soon there after and I was in and out of doctors offices and hospitals. I began taking of a lot of my parents time and attention due to the muscle disorder and Leah needed more from them. She resented me for this. She knew it was nothing I was in control of but instead of being supportive and sympathetic she retaliated by telling me ” You’re faking” “You’re a liar” and “I hate you”. I now know that at that time Leah was dealing with he rown emotional pain and adolescent challenges. She was being bullied at school, feeling a lot of insecurities over her body, struggling to keep friends and loathing being poor. I became the target for her anger with life. Of course then I didn’t know what was taking place in her life and internalized all the mean things she would say and do. I was in physically pain, struggling with my own losses and fears and all I wanted was a loving sister. This continued into our teen years.
The fantastic thing about this, is that lack of crying can be made up. Apparently. So although I've stopped her from crying all these months, future crying can make up for it.
I think about the space that is created after a loved one has passed away. They are gone, but not gone, as their memories are still so close, so vivid. They continue to exist in a space between life and death. I do not believe in an after-life, a heaven, but rather that we return to the earth, the universe, that we become part of all that is around us. And so our loved ones are gone, but also here, part of the natural spaces around us, and always in our hearts. I think, also, about the pain of grief, of learning to live with that loss, to realize that there is no “getting over” or “moving on” from a death, but that over time the pain gets easier to carry. It does not become less, but it becomes easier to bear, less likely to cut so deeply.
On the domestic front, after never having them before, The Geej has contracted lice twice since September. The most recent lice-fest began this past Tuesday when she nonchalantly mentioned at the breakfast table, "My head is itchy." And sure enough, looked at her sclap and there those nasty bastards were. I beelined it to Walgreen's and bought a remedy that lands on the effectiveness spectrum somewhere between scalp napalm and tap water. So far, so good, but WHAT a pain in the ass. I kept her home from school that day while I cleaned everything that had come into contact with her noggin for the past week and treated her scalp, twice. We're still treating her each night and looking for those goddamned nits, but the fucking school and aftercare that she attends better be doing THEIR part to check for infestation, or it's all for naught. I alerted both of them about our situation on Tuesday and got a couple of vaguely reassuring emails about their policies, etc., but I think they should put that shit on lock-down until they are sure that shit's under control. Blech. I guess the ONLY good thing about getting lice in this day and age is that there it is far less stigma around it than it was when I was a kid. I got lice in 5th grade, presumably from the new, non-English speaking student I was tutoring in, no kidding, a broom closet. Her name was Ofelia, and she was 14 years old. I was 11. Our school was utterly unprepared to handle the needs of a student who didn't speak a word of English, so they enrolled her in 5th grade (instead of 7th or 8th, where she should've been age-wise) and then assigned a "gifted" student (moi) to sit in a broom closet with her and go over books that were intended for pre-schoolers. During that period, I got lice. And not only was my mother HORRIFIED (I might as well have come home with a lamprey stuck to my face), the school kept it all on the down-low and treated me and Ofelia like we were radioactive. I was so ashamed to have gotten such a "dirty" ailment, and my mother put a stop to my daily broom closet rendezvous with Ofelia and we were, instead, allowed to sit at a small tabel in the corner of the classroom for our tutoring sessions, which meant we weren't quite so close together. I eventually got over my lice, and Ofelia eventually left our school.
Leaving his hotel room Peter leisurely strolled down the hallway towards the elevators with the confidence of a man who believe everything in his life was under his full control. Peter did find some irritation with having to wait a minute of two for the elevator. The waiting was enough of an issue that he made a mental note to find a more exclusive hotel the next time the opportunity to visit New Orleans popped up.
So how does Ian Hart’s Sacred Gin compare to my own?
According to the ancient Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, December21, 2012, is the last day of a 5,125 year long cycle. It is believed that either a cataclysmic event (end of times) or a transformative event (physical or spiritual change) will occur at the end of this cycle. Although most scholars dismiss this predication as credible, it is still a popular belief that many hold as truth.
I often find myself wondering if time will always move so quickly. And then I try to make a conscious effort to pay better attention to the people and the sights around me. Occasionally I wish I had taken time to enjoy our gardens this year, as we'll move in the spring before they bloom again. And yet, if I missed the gardens in order to spend more time with the family, is it really such a loss?
Good luck, and may you find your lobster!
One of his visitors during this time said the President received him in the nude, with a buffalo rug wrapped around him like a toga. He frequently interrupted the conversation to stride up and down the room, declaiming famous speeches in Greek and Latin. (This is not all that much different from my typical meetings with my editor.)
But maybe this trait has hurt me as a parent. Maybe the woman wrestling to be authentic in her own life has been training her kids to do the opposite.

So many thanks to Pinterest I tried some new activities with my kids this year that I hope to continue next year. So I made the earth cupcakes ( split white cake batter in half, add blue and green food coloring and then alternate pouring into the cupcake trays with a spoon). They were very yummy! The only problem I ran into was the humidity in my classroom today actually caused the red hearts I iced on top to literally melt away! So by the time the kids got them it looked like something died on top. I won't do this part next year. Definitely a learn by doing experience!

I just picked up the rosary from the post office as we were away for a few days and my mail was being held. I do not know how to express to you my excitement upon opening the box. It is extrodinary and was just what I had in mind. The colors of the crystals are so vibrant and the sterling cross and chalice are just perfect. I absolutely LOVE it, and I am sure that my grandaughter will too. When you ask her what her favorite color is, she will tell you "A Rainbow of Colors" grandma. So I can't wait until she sees her beads. I want to thank you so much for all your help and hard work by creating this SPECIAL gift for me to give to her for her communion!!!

Strength: With nine guys playing double-digit minutes, New Mexico is one of the deepest teams in college basketball. Coach Steve Alford is not afraid of playing different lineups. While only three players are averaging double-figures, seven guys are scoring at least six points per game. That’s a lot of production from a lot of different guys making the Lobos almost as dangerous when they go to their bench as when they’re playing their starters.

I’m guessing at least one of them will be Gavin. Leave me your two cents!

In effect, our athletes and artists are the priests of our cultural religion. They define greatness for us, and lead us in a mass response to that greatness. But before we dismiss the superficiality of it all, there’s something we can learn.
It seems that our favorite super rich man, Mitt Romney, was quick and emphatic about offering his support and defense of the 2008 Wall Street bailout. He credited President Bush for acting to avert an economic depression…that is an economic depression for his rich folk colleagues, buddies and business partners.
Below is Stephen Crane’s “In the Desert”, a poem that has a similar effect as the above stanza. I recall Galway Kinnell using it to preface an essay in which he talked about the nature of being a poet.
There are, of course, zillions of other cocktails that are perfectly suited to making at home - the naffly named but delicious Flirtini for one, and the mis-named but easy-drinking French Martini for another. The cocktail I most often claim I want to drink is a Hemlocktini - invented by the lovely Waffle and I as an elegant solution to extreme situations - but since a martini glass rinsed with hemlock and filled with iced vodka would be as toxic as it sounds, it's just as well the Hemlocktini exists only as a metaphor.

When we were cooling out, and ponyboy was tuckered out, we had no problems with any of the corners.

Luckily, his English to Pony translator was working because he was an excellent boy while we cooled out.

I have berated Leanne's political stance on a regular basis since I started blogging; I don't expect that to change! The posts in which I have noted that Leanne and I disagree are the ones which have attracted the greatest number of comments by both those who support her and those who agree with me! That is Leanne's strength as a party leader; she is a politician who can spark fierce debate, a woman whose opinions attract a strong response be it in her favour or against her.
“This raises concerns, as she has indicated the cages have not been repaired, and has repeatedly refused to allow animal welfare experts to evaluate if conditions are safe for the animals and sufficient to prevent them from escaping and endangering the community,” the Agriculture Department said.

Anyhow in a weeks time I will find myself standing in front of a crowd of 'Catholic Educational Professionals' who, in their brief to me, have described themselves at 10% Catholic 20% other Christian and 70% Agnostic or Atheist. Do I need to repeat the phrase 'Catholic Professional Christians' again or have you got my drift? Well having got over statistical shock I decided there just might be an opportunity for evangelism here and like St Paul I better start with looking for some common ground. Some sort of altar to the unknown God that I could claim as my own and somehow get a leg in to the rarified alternative reality that is professional agnosticism. 'Aha', says I when I found the mission statement of these 'Catholic Professional Christians' tucked away towards the end of the brief. Alas not a word in it says anything really Christian, professional or Catholic.
Our colony of bees didn't make it through the winter. I can't give you a thorough diagnosis, it could be Colony Collapse Disorder, it could have been due to extreme cold or it could just be one of those things. When we regained the colony last spring they looked a bit weak, but by high summer they had really picked up, maybe they still weren't strong enough.

Gods yes!!! I need the money so bad. I'm failing at paying some of my medical bills. However, it is seriously taking away from other things. Writing has fallen to the wayside the most.

ALL is in growth and of creation by Creator, and ALL are given life to sustain life force energy by that purity given the chance of continual growth and illuminous inner beauty back to the whole of creation.

What about the man who was lowered on a bed into a crowded house? It was obvious he needed to be able to walk again but Jesus saw deeper than that. What he needed was forgiveness of sins, a way out of the mess his life was in: “Son, your sins are forgiven.” So when he took up his bed and walked, the healed man walked with his head held high into a new story full of possibilities.

So we were very keen to squeeze in a weekend away, just the two of us, before this baby arrives. After hearing only good things about the Wotif mystery deals, we decided to get brave and try one, and ended up with a night at the Hilton Brisbane for around $160. We were assigned a Deluxe King Room, but upon check-in, we were upgraded to an Executive King Room! It was very lovely. The Hilton is quite impressive, and in its grand foyer area, we couldn’t stop giggling because we felt like we were imposters who shouldn’t be somewhere so fancy! Our room was also very lovely (with fancy features like a heated mirror which didn’t fog up no matter how hot you had your shower), but the best bit of all was I was with my husband, and we could just hang out, with nowhere to go and nothing to do… unless we wanted to of course.

This is important, and therefore it is important that US citizens, lawmen and politicians stand up when people are getting tortured and humiliated. Not just become everybody e who stands accused of a crime deserves a fair trial, but also to the rule of law and its principles is a big part of what is worth defending against those terrorists who are trying to bring down the civilized society .

And so right now, I’m working daily to reshape my feelings about this whole situation. I can’t, in good conscience, send my child off to school in the morning in a cloud of anguish and anxiety. Nothing could be more unfair to her.

The podcast jumps straight into Ricky quizzing Karl about what doesn't annoy him. When he says he's a happy-go-lucky guy, this stuns Ricky and Steve and starts their laughing at Karl. Karl starts to talk about his girlfriend Suzanne and how she manages to break things he fixes in the house through her being heavy handed, which amuses Ricky and Steve so much so to the point where they choose to talk through Karl's typical day at home.

Revolution is very negative, the murders are off course very negative, but the murders, the rapes, the fraud, corruption all eventually get sorted out by effective revolution. In the end the revolutionaries also meet their own demise. The ANC regime is slowly but surely being taken out and a revolution is rising against them. Unfortunately, because people are not seeing the revolution and they’re not seeing the big picture, they are kicking against the revolution, rather than joining and supporting it.

So, I’m probably going to get in trouble after I publish this post (what am I five?)…and no, I don’t mean “you didn’t eat your broccoli and so you don’t get dessert” or “you weren’t supposed to peek at your Christmas presents and now you’re grounded” or “you talked back to me and now you’re getting spanked” (yes, that was the extent of trouble in my childhood….I was sheltered, okay?). I mean, Emily Gilmore trouble. And for those of you who have never seen Gilmore Girls, the main character is quoted as saying this about her mother (Emily): “Well, I consider what my mother would do in a given situation, then I dial it back, and I have what Mussolini would do, then I dial it back, and I have what Stalin would do, and then I dial that back and then it starts approaching what a sane person would do.”

Upon his arrival, Alex discovers that the images and territories in the Starfighter arcade game represent an actual conflict between the Rylan Star League and the Ko-Dan Empire; the latter is led by Xur (Norman Snow), a traitor to whom the Ko-Dan Emperor has promised control of Rylos itself. The game was designed as a test to find those "with the gift"; Alex is expected to pilot an actual Starfighter spacecraft called the Gunstar. He also discovers that The Frontier is an array of planetary-scale force fields that protect Rylos and its surrounding planets from invasion and that Xur has given the Ko-Dan the means to breach it.

It is amusing to watch how we humans adapt. I have been through many changes in my life and today I am so aware of the process, paying so much more attention to it, then I ever did before. We are all creatures of habit and thus I too am slowly adapting certain habits and routines in my new home, as I have done in some many homes before. There is a difference this time around as I have never before lived with children.

What emerges most clearly of all in this film is that the Baron’s plans never work because he is incapable, being inhuman himself, of taking into account human behaviour. He never foresees his creations turning upon him, though they generally have sound reasons to do so, and he is likewise blind to his various assistants’ moral qualms. The series charts the decline of a scientific mind into a quagmire of brutishness, due to its inherent blindness to human nature, the very thing it is seeking to master.

fat you are, wants to be the one sucking wind when you are walking 3mph. I knew I would never run . . . I wasn’t a runner. Just typing that kind of makes me chuckle to myself. That was the excuse that I made for myself . . . I wasn’t a runner. I was right . . . I mean tell me one 300 pound “runner” you have seen. I just figured it came naturally to all those “skinny” people. I didn’t realize that they had to suck wind to train their bodies to run just like I did.
And the paint. I have read every blog and article on the web that discusses painting cabinets and I tried something completely different from what I had read. Have you seen those commercials for Behr "He is painting while he primes. She is priming while she paints?" I went for the premium primer included stuff from Home Depot. The black color is Behr Beluga. I painted 3 coats, sanding lightly between each one. I didn't remove the doors but I easily could (and probably should) have. I decided to distress them. This my husband wasn't too thrilled about but I know how my kids and their stool had already distressed them over the years so I figured I would save myself the headache and heartache and have them start distressed. I hit it several places with the sander and then used a darker tinted glaze (some watered down acrylic craft paint) over the sanded spots to darken up the distressed areas.
I, too, see both sides. The system they have set up in much of the British Commonwealth seems like what this country is going to have to move towards eventually... or maybe there's some other system that will work better.

Then my son came along. Again, Mum literally cried when I told her I wasn’t christening him. Mum told me if I didn’t get him christened, she was going to take him to church while she was babysitting him (she looked after him while I worked) and have it done. She was NOT risking her grandson going to hell because his mother was a heathen. So, after discussion with my husband, and a lot of thought, I decided to get the deed done, but, on MY terms. My Mum was born in Russia, so, as a child I went to Russian School, which was attached to the Russian Orthodox Church. During the Saturday School, we had four ‘classes’. Two of language, one of history and one of religion. For the last three years I was at the school, the priest was our religion teacher, but, he knew I was an atheist (one of the VERY few people I ‘came out’ to at the time). So, during the ‘religion’ classes, we did interesting things. We discussed all sorts of social, societal and philosophical questions. I remember we did a whole term on “subliminal suggestion in advertising”, where we discussed it, got ads and tried to find the subliminal messages in them, including finding little skulls in ice cubes in vodka ads, etc. But I digress. This priest knew I was an atheist. He’d allowed me to be ‘godmother’ to my beautiful god-daughter knowing I was an atheist (I will go into this more in another post, soon). So, I thought, I’ll ring him and discuss this whole child-christening thing with him.

I also own the LBB Sienna Dress Pattern, but never made a dress from it. (Only pajama tops). Once I saw that the pre-made dresses she sold had a flounce/circle skirt bottom, I wanted to make my dresses like those. They were so much cuter than the straight ruffle bottom that came with the pattern. I had always planned on figuring out the measurements to add the flounce/circle skirt bottom, but never quite got to it.
Noon Gathering– 12:15 PM
One thing we should want to take away from the quagmire of cultural politics is that we're doomed if we look to the textual qualities of objects themselves to defeat their placement in cultural commerce. Context can make films politically radical in some sense - I'm thinking of the profligacy of a work like Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie, or the anti-colonialist "missiles" by the likes of Rene Vautier (pace Nicole Brenez), or Debord's famous Howls in Favor of Sade screening (or Isou's Venom and Eternity), or even the solid and principled liberalism of a filmmaker like Bertrand Tavernier. There are a number of ways that cultural objects are political - often these ways overlap, and can even contradict each other. And often an "activist" version of cinema - a la Michael Moore (or, let's say, the Kony 2012 folks) - presumes that a political cinema is one that causes its audience to leave the theater and act in some way. Indeed this is what Eisenstein sought when he tried to devise a cinema which could play upon the spectator's sensorium in such a way as to help foment revolution. (On this, see Jonathan Beller's terrific book The Cinematic Mode of Production, whose praises I've sung many times here over the years.) But I do admire political gestures that aren't simply the instrumentalist consequences of "effective" political filmmaking. I harbor a certain romanticized liking for big, expensive movies that fail to turn a profit - and this regardless of whether I think the film is secretly good or not. I admire the Straubs and Pedro Costa, and in his own way Pasolini, whose films' very production have often sought a political and economic order alien to the hostile, dominant paradigm: i.e., matters of payment, and of closeness to the working class, the underclass, and their environments.

According to the Pew Research Firm there is an attitude change with regard to gay marriage. In 2001 the percentage of people opposing gay marriage was only 57%, while 35% supported it.

Coming home will require leadership. But post-exile leadership needs a clear focus on our identity and purpose — who are we and why are we here? What are our core values and related central beliefs? Does our polity actually support and illuminate our doctrine? Do we have a grasp of our theological task? Are we aligned with our Social Principles and are our principles relevant? Can we make the practice of the means of grace — at the very least the basics — prayer, study, service, accountability and celebration of the sacraments — central to our common life? Can we let go of the things that divide us long enough to rally around Christ? We don’t need more foot-shuffling, waffling, hemming, hawing, embarrassed awkward pauses, superficial rhetoric to remind us that we are in the wrong place at the wrong time. But we’re not dead, we’re simply lost. We don’t need resurrection (yet), but reform, renewal, restoration and a return to what we do best.

Nevertheless, the Enterprise is repaired, and rescues Kirk before Khan can destroy it. They go off in pursuit. It is an exciting, stalking naval battle between two severely damaged ships. Kirk gains the advantage because khan is thinking two dimensionally. It is a problem that occurred quite often a television trek. Ships often met face to face, but they could travel in all dimensions: up, under, etc. The Enterprise sneaks under and then behind the Reliant to score a direct hit, killing everyone but Khan. The Enterprise is crippled in the attack, so Khan decides to blow up Genesis in a suicide move that will take Kirk with him.

In an excellent confluence of events, the convention is one week before my college reunion. So here's what happened. The reunion starts June 3. I always go a few days early or stay a few days late to go to theater & concerts, visit museums, hang with friends, etc. This year, the plan was to go out on the Sunday or Monday beforehand. Now, I'm on the board of a local theatre company, and a play that was put on in Chicago in association with that company is headed to New York. The director will be in New York in April and May, coming back to Chicago the 31st. So I decided to go out on Saturday to hang with him and see the play before he leaves. But then I heard about the Book Blogger Convention on the 28th, and thought, "well, heck! Why don't I go out on Thursday and go to that?" So I am.

Another issue that gives me serious pause is how cavalier The Doctor is at manipulating someone’s past for a specific result. This seems to fly in the face of certain “rules” of the show as established by David Whitaker and altered, but still largely upheld, by Denis Spooner (and other script editors of the show). It has always been a tenuous rule that The Doctor cannot meddle in established Earth history (read: our history) except to set right what went wrong, but he can meddle in Earth’s future and the histories of other planets. However, when he meddled in the future and histories of other planets, we are to never explicitly point out that this is what he is doing, changing history, just someone else’s history. In A Christmas Carol, and much of Series 5, we are told time can be re-written, and this episode goes a long way to illustrate it. In the pre-Deadly Assassins view of The Time Lords, preventing this type of meddling is one of the major functions of The Time Lords. Without The Time Lords, New Who has had to establish certain natural correctives for the universe. Thus, we have The Reapers in Father’s Day. We have Adelaide commit suicide in Waters of Mars. And while these episodes did create very small changes from the original timeline (as did The Aztecs, where the non-interference rule was first stated), these changes seem very personal and very inconsequential. But the general theme of not changing established events is upheld. No more. The rule looks to be dead. The only question I have: To what end has Moffat dispensed with the rule? Is he re-writing Doctor Who to suit his particular story-telling devices (with a large emphasis on time travel and manipulation) or is he setting The Eleventh Doctor up for a great, catastrophic fall. If the latter, I may find the journey worth it, if the former, I may look on The Moffat era as a collection of good stories that ultimately killed Doctor Who. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration, but a rule cannot be broken without consequences, and breaking a rule as big as this needs to have severe consequences. I don’t think we have seen that yet. At least when The Seventh Doctor would break the rule, we are given the impression that he took a lot of time and care to limit the damage. That he would follow the changes and alter other histories to establish the minimal amount of change to the overall timeline. While this is breaking the non-meddling rule, it is showing that there are distinct consequences to breaking it and that you must exercise a large amount of caution and put a great deal of work and thought into the change. You cannot be flippant about it, which The Eleventh Doctor is.
Oh, well, the name Bellybutton came to me one stormy night, somewhere in July, while I was sitting with my synthesizer in my lap, trying to make a worthy electronica influenced remix with bossanova elements for Radiohead's Karma Police. Suddenly I felt the room chilling itself to a moderate 17 degrees Celsius. I asked myself: "How could it be? I did close the door to the freezer, didn't I?" I couldn't ask for my bandmates' help since they were all outside playing softball, so I got up....or at least I tried to...but I was suddenly pushed back in the chair while a strange figure was taking shape in front of my very eyes.

If Eve and her daughters gave birth like the planets, two at a time, one male and one female, and they were exceedingly long lived and always fertile, never entering into menopause, each one of these females may have produced a vast posterity. Just using an imaginary number and saying that Eve was able to give birth 1000 consecutive times, once every 10 months, during a period of 833 years, and supposing that she gave birth to twins each time, a son and a daughter, this would mean that she gave birth to 2000 children, of which 1000 were daughters. Those 1000 daughters, doing the same as her, would each give birth to 1000 daughters. This would give Eve 1000 daughters and 1,000,000 grand-daughters. And so on and so forth: 1 billion great grand-daughters, 1 trillion great great grand-daughters, etc. Obviously, these are just imaginary numbers, not taking into account premature deaths, etc.
The disturbance can be so pervasive that the mental lives of some individuals revolve only around activities that lessen gender distress. They are often preoccupied with appearance, especially early in the transition to living in the opposite sex role. Relationships with parents also may be seriously impaired. Some males with gender identity disorder resort to self-treatment with hormones and may (very rarely) perform their own castration or penectomy. Especially in urban centers, some males with the disorder may engage in prostitution, placing them at a high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Suicide attempts and substance-related disorders are common.

HALO has a good story line, its just very slow. Like molasses in winter slow. I was expecting so much from this book by all the reviews I have read and I mean, HAVE YOU SEEN THE COVER?! It is FANTASTIC! The book just seemed to drag on and on uneventfully. While Alexandra does have a great tone throughout the book, Bethany just wasn't the best character. I kept finding myself smacking the book and groaning, "omg...are you REALLY that stupid?!" I highly doubt I will read the rest of this series.

And we teased her the entire ten minute drive to the surprise. We told her people were staring at us and someone was calling the police on their cell because I had abducted her. She was mortified, but Kerri laughed and giggled the entire ten minutes. I warned Kerri not to give the surprise away, and told her not to say a word.

The main top layer of fabric on this skirt finds Asian fishing boats drifting across deep crimson seas. Amid green boughs and Spring blossoms there are also tea houses, arching bridges and wooden walking paths through peaceful water gardens. The bottom layer of fabric peeks out in contrast along the bottom edge and through a sassy side-split. Ancient Chinese characters flow freely, telling untold stories across a papyrus colored background.
Many were the days in my youth that I spent up at the Zelinka household. Megen, Emily, and I were very close friends and, with the wealth of land and pond their property offered, we had countless ways to pass our childhood afternoons. The afternoon I am most concerned with here took place probably when I was about 9 or 10. It was a gusty fall day, with leaves scudding across the fields and little miniature waves rocking the pond’s surface. After finishing our schoolwork for the day, the three of us decided to take the rowboat out onto the pond and see what mischief we could create. It was a normal plan and something we’d done hundreds of times. Little did we know that this afternoon was not going to follow the norm.
After the establishment and formalization fo the covenant in Ch 10, there came the difficult work of repatriating the City of Jerusalem. It was one thing to rebuild, but it is another thing completely for the leader to inspire those who had established lives elsewhere…to pick up and return to the City of Jerusalem.
So, what should happen is this. In light of the lack of public consultations about the future of the strategic gap and the uncertainty about any future strategic gap policy, the BHA plan should be rejected on the grounds of ‘prematurity’. Then and only then can Adur and Lancing Parish work with the community to decide the right way forward and hopefully agree a policy that encourages growth and re-generation, but respects the rights of the local residents to ‘enjoy their property and their local amenity’ and protects our valuable ‘green wedges’ for use by ALL the community and not just a small minority.
I just laughed. I was so glad that she was doing ok. Now she tells me she wished she lost the other front tooth also so she could have an even goofier smile. Gotta love kids.
Then I got even more excited when the desire to revise kicked in full gear, after a much needed breather, and I started work, cutting here, adding there. I was making slow but steady progress when I saw something interesting.

I guess that technology increasingly removes this divide, but short of fully immersive video environments, typically the online world is includes more text and discussion, less audio and video. There is an inbuilt moderation and self reflection in this type of discussion.
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the surest sign that an American city had “arrived” and become truly important, was the construction of a “grand hotel,” a place impressive and luxurious enough to house visiting heads of state and international celebrities, where balls and political events would be held, where the accommodations, fixtures, and food were more lavish and exotic than were common in the area.

Many authors, professional and amateur, confuse bickering with conflict, but unless there is an element of desire, such as one of the characters wanting information that the other doesn’t want to give, then there is no conflict, merely disagreement. I made that mistake in Light Bringer. I had a lot of historical information I needed to impart, so I had a group of people arguing about it in the hope that it would seem more immediate, but since there was no desire, except the relative low tension one of the characters wanting to be heard, it came across as bickering. I kept the section because it was a more interesting way of presenting the material than a lecture, and it did show the personalities of the characters, but there was not the immediacy conflict would have brought to the piece.

I actually have three works in progress. The latest one was a crazy idea. In the busiest month of my life, with book promotion tasks piling up, I decided to join the NanoWrimo contest and attempt to write a 50,000-word novel in the thirty days of November. The idea comes from a real life experience--I was having odd dreams after which I'd wake up feeling there was something very important I had forgotten. I know it was just my mind's way of dealing with the anxiety of being a newly published author, but the idea appealed to me as a story. I started asking my "what if" questions and ended up with a psychological/scientific thriller. I didn't complete 50,000 words by November 30th, but I'm happy with the 25,000 or so I've written so far.

The following ‘paragraph’ comes from an essay I wrote for an English class back in high school. I always ‘ace’ (A+) English class and so looking back now, I wonder whether my teacher read a word of what I wrote. However, writing for the teacher is different from writing for a blog. In a blog you need to capture attention, not put your reader to sleep. (Don’t read the following, just observe the mass of text. Read what follows instead.)

As a result most people, clearly including the new manager, presumed that Forest would be investing in a refreshed promotion bid but somewhere in the next 100 odd days the vision fell apart. The club did commit to substantial wages for five new signings, but clearly communication broke down at some point and in the end both manager and Chairman felt the need to resign.

Problem is…folks don’t want to be out of control. They want to be in love …but they still want to keep those walls in place. They want to be chased…...but not caught. Theyre proud of their independence and life on “uncatchable island”. That way………you can’t get hurt.

Let me just say... I wasn't sure (once again) that I was going to make it on time. Life just seems to take so many different directions... and is so ever changing! For example... my boss asked me Saturday to work on Sunday. That wasn't a problem at all, I was happy to do it... but it wasn't planned. Crafting was planned! Monday was errand day with my dear husband. We don't always have 'date time'... but spending time with him running errands is enough sometimes. Well, our errand time somehow lead us to truck shopping... and then truck buying. Yes, I have a new truck! Well... new to me anyway. It is a 10 year old F150... but I am more than thrilled to have it! Anyway... all the interruptions to my crafty time meant I had to really focus this evening to get things done. And... I'm happy to report... I met the deadline.
At any rate, he says that the elections in Europe don’t say much about the policy concerns of the European voters, as the results are mostly about the principle that, “voters toss out incumbents and reward insurgents if the economy is bad, never mind the specifics of their platforms.” So, he says, France is not moving to the left but, yes, Greece is really fubar.
So, given Austen’s preference for the “gay” consciously (as seen in her letters to Anna), Austen would go for Harriet Byron primarily to start with. Then maybe she’d swing round for another correction, and then another.

Now, opposing Saddam and the Sunnis were the Kurds, and the Shia. After the US invasion, the Sunnis were the most active guerrillas fighting the US presence in country, but recently they were literally paid off using US taxpayer money. US soldiers simply started to give large sums of money to the Sunni leaders in exchange for them not shooting Americans anymore. It worked... somewhat (Americans are of course still targeted, because they are occupying a foreign country etc).

Yeah, one of those days. I’m not being a negative Nancy here or anything (that’s never the answer to anything!) but I’m just putting it out there and accepting it.
The spa and the Met both employed Neil Wallis, ex-Deputy Editor of News Of The World, to do their PR. Both sides say this is a coincidence and they didn't know about it. Stephenson now says the real reason was that he should have told the Prime Minister that Wallis was implicated in the phone hacking scandal.
Remember that before the death of Christ, the disciples did not want to be seen with the Lord. All fled from Him. Even Peter denied Him three times and the last with an oath. While He was in the grave, they hid themselves, as they were afraid for their lives lest those who hated the Lord would link them to Him and crucify them as well. You may say how little faith they had but we must not point the accusing finger without checking our own testimony for Jesus Christ.

Was Jesus a real person? What of the bible can be backed up by historical fact and what appears to be fiction? The arguments I read are very detailed and very convincing. I could right a book about the books I just read! Perhaps I will do that later, but for now I would like to theorize about Jesus. Taking into consideration the recent book The Jesus Tomb and the novelization of Mary Magdalene by Ki Longfellow—here is my proposition.
Now I must pause and confess something to you all, something about which I feel rather chagrined. I do not actually read that many blogs. I know. This is crazy talk. There’s this whole great community and all these talented people and I really do not have any good excuse. I have excuses, mind you, they just aren’t very good. Excuse #1 is of course the fact that for most of the year that I have been blogging I was struggling to write a thesis. These little blog posts were my little breath of air before diving back into the sea of data that was my life. I didn’t really take a lot of time to read and what time I did I spent reading books rather than internet content. Only now that I’m done and procrastinating online more often whilst looking for scientist postings am I taking time to explore the wide world of blogging. Since I have been actually working really hard at trying to find work (this is the promised Excuse #2 b.t.w) I haven’t actually been reading a whole heck of a lot of blogs. Here, during the paragraph break, I hang my head in a moment of shame.

How did Rio achieve their reduced recoil goal? Quite simply by taming down the load and cutting velocity back by 150fps or so. Once again... will that 150fps matter at 25 yards? Perhaps more important might be the quicker follow up shot, and better control. A cloud of nine OO pellets fired from any shotgun at any significant velocity is a fearsome thing to face from the downrange side, but with the reduced recoil shells it need be a little less scary from the shooters perspective as well.

On Monday, November 9, 1868, at 5PM eight students, seven black and one white, and five faculty, began classes at the Medical Department of Howard.
Last year we had about 250 people so I'm super pumped about seeing everyone tonight and hoping for a bigger crowd!
The department had a policy on tattoos that if they were visible they had to be completely covered. Well I had no choice so I showed up with my entire right arm covered because I have a full sleeve (from the top of my shoulder to my wrist) tribal tattoo. When my F.T.O. showed up I noticed that he had a half sleeve and it was uncovered. I said, “Hey, how come you aren't covering your tat up?” That's when I heard those beautiful words!!! The Sheriff changed the policy. Wooo-hooo! Let em fly, so I did. I immediately hit it off with my F.T.O. He looks just like me, shaved head and tats. I got in his car which is a K9 unit. They have non aggressive K9's that are drug, bomb, etc. dogs which is cool. Of course as soon as I got in there that bastard starting passing some serious gas. This dog sh@t on me all day and laughed about it, so did his daddy. Whew it was bad, but God was it good to be the POLICE again. I had to laugh at my first call- a horse running loose! Are you kidding me really?!? Okay, so we didn't find lil horsey running around but hey, it was a call. We handled some domestics which are all about the same anywhere you are. Then the first alert tone came at about 1230, accident on the interstate, over turned van with serious injuries. Hell yea baby, lights and siren!!! Now its been awhile but I remembered how to yell and scream at stupid idiots that panic when they see a police car coming. So after sorting through a few F bombs we got there to find a van full of guys all cut up, bruised up and scraped up. Of course no one was wearing a seat belt. Making things even more of a pain in the butt, they were all Mexican and none of them spoke English. One of them had a right arm arterial bleed and massive blood loss. There were several paramedics there so no need to get bloody. I finally felt productive again and respected. We really only provided traffic control for the Highway Patrol but man did it feel good! We left that and handled a few more calls ending the day with me actually handling another crash but this time the at fault driver had a suspended license and a warrant. Jackpot! I get to put an ass in jail again! Man that was fantastic!!!

For some time now, I have wanted to look at who the best scorers in ASC play were this past season. Now, I am going to do it. I am going to base the notion of “best scorer” on three factors: workload, shooting skill, and ball protection. For workload, I am using a player’s shot percentage (Shot%), or how many of his team’s shots he took while on the floor. Most high workloads will be upwards of 25% of a team’s shots while he is on the floor. For shooting skill, I am using true shooting percentage (TS%), which translates a player’s shooting percentages on twos, threes, and free throws into an equivalent two-point shooting percentage. For ball protection, I am using a player’s turnover percentage (TO%), or the percentage of the time a player commits a turnover relative to the number of times he tries to score.

That is why they are called a CRASH. dictionary.com defines a ‘crash’ as:

I realized for as long as I kept my struggle to myself, no one was the better for it. I was miserable, and other moms like me thought they were alone, too. But when I started talking, that is - when I got real, and honest, and gave vulnerability a chance - it was as if a whole new world opened up. Not only was I set free to be real, but so were the women with whom I spoke. And we have developed a bond, a community of support and understanding. I love it!
I climbed up to the pool deck to assess the damage. And there, right in the middle of the pool, was a fairly large poop. And it wasn't a floater, because that would be too easy. No, it was a sinker and it was sitting at the bottom of the pool, mocking me. My brother was there, laughing at me and disgusted with me, simultaneously. I asked him where Kerry (the owner of the pool) was and what the "plan" was. Do pool owners have special equipment for such things? No, they don't. The plan was to use a pail and the pool cleaner net thingy to dive down to the bottom of the pool and scoop out the poop. So, Kerry and I put on some kid goggles, each got a pail and net thingy, and took turns diving for poop. Ya...that really happened.
Gussie Fink-Nottle is a 3-year-old mixed breed we adopted from the Seattle Animal Shelter. We needed a puppy for our puppy, The Empress.

1. Reason claims because the Supreme Court will only overturn the individual mandate but leave the rest of Obamacare…because Romney and the Republicans don’t have the guts now to overturn the rest of the law we should let Obama stay in office and let a real reformer get in office in 2016 who will then overturn the law. Common sense states that you would give some reasons to back this up but Reason’s article seemed quite lacking, in well, reason.
But before that, I thought I should come clean, and confess I recently bought a pair of uber-wellies myself. My job often requires me to trudge through mud water, and filth, and no matter what the advertising says, I've yet to find a leather waterproofer that works for long. So I end up with cold wet feet. I had some wonderful wellies, they were made by Nokia.

The growing up of suburbs occupied solely by any individual class is bad, socially, economically, and aesthetically. It is due to the wholesale and thoughtless character of town development, and is quite foreign to the traditions of our country ; it results very often in bad municipal government and unfair distribution of the burdens of local taxation, misunder- standing and want of trust between different classes of people, and in the development and exaggeration of differences of habit and thought ; it leads, too, to a dreary monotony of effect, which is almost as depressing as it is ugly.

This brings me to myths, folklore, and mystical stories concerning language. There are plenty of stories about the invention of language, often imbedded within larger creation myths. What I found particularly fascinating is that the concept of the power of "the word" is basic to virtually all of the world's spiritual traditions.

I don't want to wreck the show for those who haven't seen it, but I do have to specify that an alien power has come to earth and is demanding a tribute of children: 10% of the world's population of children, in fact. "Absurd!", you say. Well, of course. But mark how the writers deal with this somewhat improbable premise.

-Stuck with my staple detergent that I'm also using for all of Adeline's other clothes--All Free and Clear with Oxy-Clean. I found a great site here that outlines all possible detergents that can be used with cloth diapers and how well they work. I'm not about spending high dollar for special detergent if my normal detergent will work. So far so good.

TIP: Check out “Apps Gone Free” daily postings of paid apps that are free for a short period. This would only apply if you have your own iPad. School purchased iPads wouldn’t be able to accommodate such a quick purchase. Sometimes it’s just that day, sometimes for a few days, but a great way to save money. Many are games, but there are some other kinds of apps every now and again. Check our their website click here.

Now go rent the movie version of Hamlet (1991) starring Mel Gibson and suddenly all of the power of the play comes alive.

The question is how the aging Baby Boomers will accept the changes to legislation that eases them out of their big empty nests. I imagine with a big ‘no fucking way’ at the ballot box; which means we can probably chalk up the future to more of this kind of ‘nailing granny to the floor’ thing. It’s the new way of sharing the wealth around across generations.

There are quite a few different flavors including acai berry and blueberry.

But as I pedaled along next to him I realized he was no better than me. With his perfect physical condition and his two fit flesh and bone legs, he was not that different from me. He was getting a good work out on that bike. So was I. My resistance levels might have been different than his, but I was full into my work out, just like him.

I suppose I was hoping for the same kind of magic on this trip. Believing that perhaps removing myself from the hum drum of my daily routine, the chores that are constantly beckoning, and the phone that seems to be always buzzing; that I might allow myself a moment to breath, and to purge another piece or two of those thoughts, memories, dreams, and fears that I’ve been carrying. While I haven’t been writing, I have been reading and just finished re-reading Bag of Bones by the infallible Stephen King – a story that I suggest for anyone and everyone, whether you’re looking for an escape from reality, a good fright, or in my case, inspiration and reassurance that even an award winning novelist created by the master, experiences (and overcomes) writers block every now and again.
I've been reluctant to partition off any part of the space here. Mostly, because the transparent canopy doesn't really lend itself to it, also I would have preferred to let the furniture define the divisions of space. Anyway, I broke down and added a half-height wall towards the cockpit platform, that will be the logical place for a small entertainment center (click on images to view full size.)
Being a mom, I have a special place in my heart for children; not just my own but all of them. (This is not to say all moms feel this way, but that I feel this way because I am a mom.) It hurts me in a way that I can't describe when I hear of a child or children being hurt through malice or neglect. As I have written before, I can't help them all. I can't. It hurts to admit that too. I cannot help them all, but it is a truth. All I can do is pray that they are taken care of, that their suffering doesn't damage them, or that their suffering ends one way or another. Goddess be merciful to your children. Hold them close to You and shelter them in the safety of Your arms. Let the thunder of Your heartbeat and the wind of your Breath be their lullaby until such time as they may join us again.

However, it's interesting that the resignations comes less than 48 hours after it was revealed that the toppest of the Met's top brass, including Stephenson himself, made not one but two intimidating visits to the Guardian to tell them that their coverage of the hacking scandal was exaggerated.

I take pride in my intelligence. I have a photographic memory, an above average IQ, I break records and I have a lot to show for it, I am the best at what I do. But for some reason, when it comes to matters of the heart, I am nothing but an idiot. And this is not just about romantic love, this is also about platonic love. For some reason I have a hard time letting go of the people who hurt me. Maybe it’s because I get attached too easily. God I am such a doormat.
Tactics as gunner: The missiles are slow but mildly heat-seeking against vehicles, who should be your first duty. The explosions are large but not overly powerful, making them a sub-par choice against a single spartan. More than ever, the driver should let the gunner get a good aim or else the slow reload will be their downfall.

Sometimes, I blog more for others reading than I do for myself because it matters to them. When I feel like I'm just babbling, someone may be relating to what I'm saying and thanking God that they are not in this alone. I blog for the same reasons I read other peoples blogs. It helps me. Maybe not every blog I can relate to... but the journey an struggles and success in general I can relate to. If I can reach one person reading my blog and let them see the "real side" of weight loss (AKA - it's not easy, it's not fun, it SUCKS!) and let them see that they're not in this alone, THAT is the reason I blog.

Ah, Hareton. Like Heathcliff, he’s disowned and forced to work in the fields, but he has it much worse as he SHOULD rightfully be the master of Wuthering Heights. As a result of the abuse he receives from Heathcliff and the teasing he gets from Cathy and Linton, he’s every bit as sullen as Heathcliff was as a boy. However, he seems to have a more charitable spirit, as we know that he never touches Linton no matter how much he provokes him, and Hareton also does his best to improve himself in the only ways he knows how. So yes, Hareton and Heathcliff are both disowned, disenfranchised souls, but Hareton doesn’t seem to carry the same evil intentions for his oppressors as Heathcliff does.
How quickly things can change in the world of football! A little under a month ago, Manchester United’s noisy neighbours looked to have been well and truly silenced: thanks to a late Mikel Arteta strike they had left the Emirates Stadium in despair having suffered a defeat that left them eight points behind their rivals in the race to become the 2011/12 Premier League Champions. Their misery appeared to be fully justified: Sir Alex Ferguson’s teams simply do not surrender those kinds of leads this late on in the season, until now anyway. Fast forward twenty three days and City’s fans are in full voice having seen United lose two and draw one of their four games since taking such a seemingly unassailable lead in this season’s title race.

As I read the first chapters of Healing is a Choice, a book I will review later, I had one of those moments of realization when I could see something from a differing perspective as if I were seeing if for the very first time. I was reading about how God always used people to bring about healing, that there was a connection between people for healing to occur. Throughout the book, thus far, connection is a key theme to all healing. I see this as an answer to a question that has plagued me for years.

A boy with a kettle full of hot tea and some glasses tries to help and asks for the cloth claiming it to be his. I plead him to let it be with me as it is the only thing I have to cover my body.

The funniest thing is that with all his top billing, Rupert himself has a very small part in this film! Here's the whole deal in a nutshell! Shortly after the Amendolas moved in, Dingle suddenly has $1500.00 a week coming in from an old gold mind investment, and he doesn't trust the bank, so he squirrel's in off into the wall, not knowing that Rupert resides there too. Mrs. Amendola happened to be praying to God at the same time, when from out of the sky and through the broken skylight drops 15 one hundred dollar bills courtesy of Rupert and the unknowing Mr. Dingle. Next thing you know, she's praying every Thursday at the same time that he's making his deposits, and the Amendolas are suddenly becoming very wealthy!

A short hike down the cliff is our favorite beach (so far) for shells. This beach is called Survivor Beach! I think it is because you are thankful you survived the hike down the cliff. Of course, there is always the hike back up! We have found some amazing shells here. On one trip Sammy, Bethany and I were playing in a tide pool and there were so many shells. What was even more amazing was that they were all perfect. It was like someone came and just dropped them all there for us to find. We were quickly filling our bags and within minutes we started becoming a little more particular about what we actually put in our bag. As we were searching we were talking about how shocked the others would be when they saw all we had found.

No one should be allowed to participate in, or accompany someone to an MRI, and then be allowed to drive afterward. Seriously--after Miss Mae's MRI last week--I literally felt like I had narcolepsy on the way home--and had to pull into the nearest 7-11 for a caffeine fix. I'm used to running around like a crazee lady everywhere--so, when put into a dimly lit, tight space for almost an hour-- I nearly gave myself whiplash from all of the winks I was trying to catch-but not trying to catch--because there was a guy in another room--performing the MRI who could see the whole freak show through a window. Yeah, and this was the day I had "Cousin It" hair, so I'm pretty sure it was a sight to see....
I will even go so far as to say that I almost stopped watching this movie about fifteen or twenty minutes in. The lead female character Ally (Anna Faris) reads a magazine article that says the average woman has slept with (insert any number here). In a moment of boredom, Ally makes a list of all the men she's slept with in her short single life and is shocked when that number is so much higher than the magazine article states is normal.

When I was very young, I used to pray that I would have the strength to be a martyr.

With increasing self-knowledge, I have considerably lengthened the list of things not to be included.

Drugs are bad, mmm'kay. Requiem For A Dream is a movie that I've seen frequently top "most depressing films of all time" lists, piquing my curiosity on many an occasion. A bit of cinematic misery can be good for the soul sometimes, so I approached Requiem hoping for the next Jurassic Bark or death of Buffy episode. Requiem For A Dream is very depressing. Shockingly so, sometimes. But still I was left disappointed. Maybe it's because I've seen the worst of the worst. Maybe it's because I'm an emotionless shell. Maybe it's because I've never tried drugs nor particularly liked the druggies I once called friends (if you can call someone who sits in a field on a cold winter's day smoking weed a 'druggie'). But Requiem For A Dream left me with little more than an indifferent "huh."
Well, this happens to me so many times; I can’t do the same thing day after day, be it attending the so-called study temple- school or even staying at home- reading and seeing and thinking and doing nothing but distracting my mind- its strange but that makes me bad-tempered because when I do more of that stuff ot rather more of anystuff, I get shriveled up from deep inside and you can’t expect me to be very polite and calm during such a moment. Well. that is what happen s with me- I don’t cause it and I can’t do anything in this regard.

I think it’s piggish and severe insecurity that makes a person feel they have to “keep their partners on their toes ” by using flirting as a way to do so. If a person has to keep their partner on their toes by flirting with other individuals in front of them, then it’s very telling that the flirting partner is insecure in their relationship and doesn’t have what it takes to maintain a relationship in a healthy and ethical manner without using manipulative tactics to keep someone (who is also obviously equally insecure if they put up with this behavior)around.

So much had taken place in 2001.

It had been an extremely challenging year, but I had learned so much.

The obsession with square fottage is hopefully a thing of the past. When it comes to a home bigger is not necessarily better. Look at the propotions of your home and garden, building an extension might mean that you lose valuable garden space or you might find that the original front room becomes redundant.
That’s because the Vita is able to hold even a game like Uncharted: Golden Abyss in stasis while you return to the Vita menus and change some settings etc. As soon as you want to return to the game, it resumes instantaneously, even if you put the console to sleep and leave it alone for 48 hours.

The first minute or two of a patient’s first appointment with me is always the most telling. In these first few minutes I begin to get a sense of what the patient expects out of their time with me. Some don’t know what to expect, as they have never been to a physical therapist before. Some have seen a physical therapist before and had either a good or bad experience. That expectation is at times brought with them when they see me. The hardest type of expectations for me to deal with are those of a patient who has a preconceived notion of what physical therapy is and expects to be treated in that way, whether it is a notion that I agree with or not. Some my patients have no expectations at all, as this is their first time in physical therapy. Their doctor told them to go but that is all they know.
We moved to England when I was 7 months pregnant with Rebecca, and I remember, so vividly, that last long week of waiting . . . and how the days seemed to be suspended, caught in amber, dragged out into long golden twilight.

I still maintain my landline and DSL, but for seven years, I had a bare-bones prepay phone as a matter of necessity: you know, one pre-buys a finite number of "minutes" and airtime. Not a smartphone. But it fulfilled my limited needs: got great reception, the minutes were relatively inexpensive when bought in bulk, it sent and received text messages. I use my iPod Touch for data and apps.
There were years when there were sooooooo many little kids with sooooooo many needs and demands that I could have SWORN they would NEVER grow up. And yet here we are. How and when did this happen?
One More Tip:
A review of the earlier case in 2010 sparked a wave of arrests and charges.

At one point, after one of those silences, he said, “You’re in good shape; you used to talk off the wall.” I puzzled over that one for awhile, then recalled that when I had been badgering him to endorse my book and he wasn’t returning any of my emails, each time I wrote him I opened with a bigger apology: “I don’t mean to be a nuisance, please forgive me, maybe you didn’t get my email” etc., and then even sent him a snail-mail letter on top of all that, until I finally browbeat him into at least agreeing to read my manuscript, but then as press time approached and I saw no blurb from him forthcoming, I bugged him one last time, and my apology had escalated to, “I know you must hate me and think I should rot in hell for all of eternity, but please know that our deadline is next week.”
So yesterday was our Ward's (church congregation) Christmas Party. The decorations were FABULOUS!!! Brooke (the one in charge) really went all out - SO festive. Way to go, Brooke!!! Our theme was "A Whooville Holiday". From, The Grinch. I just LOVE those greens and reds together. That almost lime green is SO cool!
There are some other points I’d like to address, but I’m reserving a second post for that. Stay tuned.
We’ve decided to coincide the official lighting of lanterns with Earth Hour as it represents a great opportunity for people to take time to get out of their houses, mingle with neighbours, enjoy a stroll along our street and enjoy the sight of some beautiful lanterns away from any electrical devices.

The journey to becoming parents felt redeeming for us in many ways. It felt like it healed places that were caused by our rocky first year. Struggling some with infertility gave us something to lean on each other for in ways that brought us closer together. Honestly, I wouldn't change that part of our love story for the world. It was a beautiful thing we did together. I was honored to struggle and cry, wait and hope, alongside this man.

Anyways. My only issue with Vickie and her secrets, is that I am pretty sure she discriminates against the big girls. And when I say girls I don't mean boobs this time. I mean actual girls. Ladies. Women. Women who may not be the size of Heidi Klum and all her cronies, but still want to feel sexy in their chonies. I personally have always loved to wear cutesie bras and panties because I can't wear everything I want.
The worst won-loss record of the past 40 years was 1-6 in 1995. But that record was an anomaly. Four players from the 1994 team had been drafted by the CFL. The 1995 team had a strong defense, led by Kyle Walters, Kevin Mellow, Bill Brown and Bill Vastis but lacked an experienced QB and stud RB Gerrit Stam. With the return of Stam and the addition of two experienced QBs - Nathan Body and Wally Gabler – the team bounced back to win the 1996 Yates Cup.

Another thing I did yesterday was to join a writer's group. I've been a part of online ones on and off for years, but this one is a face to face group. I was nervous to say the least. Reading a critique of your work in the safety of your own home, where no one can see you cry and gnash your teeth is one thing, but to have someone tell you what they thought right to your face is terrifying. Or so I thought. It actually wasn't that bad. We even had fun. Even better, I found out what was bugging me about Chapter One, as well as a 'staring me in the face' way to fix it that I would never have seen because I was focused too closely.
The vulture on the Palazzo Grassi, real as it looks, is not a live projection of my deadline-damaged imagination. It is, in fact, ‘art’, created by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, leaders of the contemporary Chinese art scene, who create sculptures and installations using a variety of unconventional materials such as cadavers, human fat tissues and waste material. According to the Palazzo Grassi website, ‘a perennial obsession with death in their work is blended with a macabre comic appeal’. About the vulture, the site explains, ‘This menacing animal humorously embodies the cruelty of the modern world: we become the carrion-eater’s potential prey – an unpleasant position, as vultures typically devour the wounded, the sick, or the remains of animals killed and eaten by other predators.’
But hey - "real life" is messy, unorganized, unplanned, unexpected things stop working (like our stove for a few days!), and a work in progress. And real life isn't always happy, we don't all get along, I anger too fast at my kids and the checklist of things to do just gets longer. But when my kids go to bed and I look at these pictures, or remember that I did a cartwheel in the yard just for a laugh or the fact that Bella worked all day at getting us to "pretend to be in a marching band!" I realize real life ain't too bad. If it were only all cartwheels and no to-do lists, we'd be set! But for real - we've had a hard year. And I'm so thankful that I can see what we do have and feel blessed. Because we are.
There's still boatloads to do, after all, it's a quite an undertaking to set up an automated brewery that will triple the size of the one that has been producing 15,000 barrels of beer annually for a while now.
whether the fact that Sweden has not implemented, in the prescribed period, Directive 2006/24, had an impact on the previous question.
One way to make sure you aren’t running away from your problems is to notice whether you are moving towards something that is exciting in its own right, as opposed to something that is appealing only because it is not where you are now. For example, if you are leaving a city because you feel you can’t afford it, you could be reinforcing poverty consciousness, and you might find that you are unable to make ends meet in your new city as well. It would ultimately be less of an effort to stay where you are and look more deeply into your beliefs about money. You may discover that as you address these issues, you are able to make more money simply by changing your mindset. You may still decide to move, but it will be an act with a positive intention behind it and not an escape, which could make all the difference.

This one is particularly annoying, because it’s so badly considered. Not only do bad things happen to good people, but — equally irritating — good things happen to bad ones. But that’s a problem for the atheist, not the Christian.

I have also starting watching vintage dress patterns and fabrics with a view to making the third attempt in my life at teaching myself to actually follow a pattern. My first purchase arrived in the post this morning, so when I finally get around to ordering some fabric, finding the right binding tape and the perfect buttons, I'll let you know how this goes.
As you probably expected, I ventured out before the break of dawn for Black Friday. The stores on my list were Lord & Taylor, Anthropologie, LOFT, J. Crew, Banana Republic, Talbots, and Crate and Barrel. The sales at J. Crew and Banana Republic seemed comparable to their typical sales, so I didn't brave the long lines. I did take advantage of the sales at Anthropologie and LOFT to pick up a few gifts. And Lord & Taylor had some wonderful deals on jewelry that will be perfect for BF's mom.
My parents arrived on Saturday evening...which poor them, what a crazy day! Their first flight left at 12ish, so they tried to eat a quick lunch before boarding, but apparently both ended up with crappy food. On the airplane they got pretzels. They had a 45 mins stop in Tampa, but really weren't supposed to get off the plane...so by the time they got to PR at 7:30, they were starved. Papa and the kids dropped me off at the airport to meet them outside baggage claim. That all went smooth...until we went to to the bus pick up line for the rental car....an hour later, the bus finally came. Every other company had numerous busses passing through...not ours. I won't name names, but let's say they weren't very good at "picking us up". Once we got there, we met Papa and the kids there. Everyone was so excited to see each other! Papa and Grandpa waited in line to get the 15 passenger van we'd reserved. It took another hour to get the van......to the lot. They hadn't brought it over, it was not ready. After they got it to the lot, they had to inspect it, wash it, and then finally turn it over. So by 10:00, we were FINALLY on the road to home....everyone starving!
Streamline and Scarlet Runner Beans - I've never had too much luck with beans around here. The summers are never hot enough to get really strong plants before the pests come in. Runners like cooler weather so we'll see if that does the trick.
Firstly, this is the picture of MBLAQ fathers and the kids.
When had things been good? What point in time was I so eager to return to, where I hadn’t been wracked by guilt or nervousness? By the time I got over my fear of getting caught, I’d run away from home and cut ties with my dad. Then, before I could come to terms with that, I’d found out about Dinah, which had affected me more than anything else. I’d terrorized hostages, maimed a supervillain, hurt superheroes, but it was Dinah that left me lying awake at night, feeling helpless, feeling like I was the scum of the earth.
I was blown away by the bags that have already been linked to our first linky for Bags and Totes and have so enjoyed looking at the fabulous bags, tutorials and pattern reviews. Remember, this linky is ongoing, so you can continue to add bags throughout the year.

Moving in to the future, I continue to have high expectations both of myself and others. I draw inspiration from the women around me and from women who are doing something to make the world a better place. Some have called me the “Queen of The World,” perhaps because I am such a know it all. But I have decided that I would rather take a page from Peggielene Bartels’ book and be King Doris, because this would give me the power to take action. I take pride in being a professional woman and admire women like King Peggy http://kingpeggy.com/ and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy http://sharmeenobaidfilms.com/ who are making a difference for women in the world http://www.savingfacefilm.com/ .

The Papists were the Roman Catholics who wanted the English church to be returned under the authority of the Pope. They were excluded from the translation process and attempted to assassinate King James and blow up Parliament in the foiled Gunpowder Plot on 5 November. This is remembered annually in the Guy Fawkes fire works.
Naked dreams
It was a lot like a sporting event, the way people got so into it. We were still chanting, "RED! RED! RED! RED!" when we were out in the parking lot, and complete strangers would join in because none of us wanted the experience to end. Overall, Medieval Times is a really fun place to plan a weekend with friends who know how to have a good time. (Plus there's alcohol involved, which is badass.)

“He was Chairman of this, Trustee of that, President of the other,” Dickens wrote of Merdle, presaging justifications used by Madoff investors a century and half later. “The weightiest of men had said to projectors, ‘Now, what name have you got? Have you got Merdle?’ And the reply being in the negative, had said ‘Then I won’t look at you.’”
when, in the past, his clones claimed the dragon family were the good guys he was working with…so this proves that a clone was writing in the past and this Fulford is an original. But what happened? Was he hood-winked and fooled, or was all that past stuff lies the clone was programmed to say?
I think it is imperative before I begin to state that I am not religious. I don’t necessarily believe in God (although the truth of the matter is that I have no clue), and I’m not even a very “spiritual” person as many non-believers claim to be. Not to be cliché, but I look at the universe from a more scientific perspective, and see no evidence for or against the existence of God. Thereby, in accordance with Occam’s razor, I deduce that no god or higher power exists (although I suppose the Occam’s razor argument could be used against me, by saying that the existence of God is simplest explanation – although I would counter that the creation of existence of God is too immense a concept to be called simple).

One of the best things about living in military housing is they drop a park about every 5 feet. You pretty much can’t go down a street in any neighborhood without hitting one. However, they are grossly underused by my family. Why? One, because I’m the worst about getting wrapped up in my own to do list that I don’t think about taking a break and walking over with the kids instead of herding them to the toy box in the living room. And two, because of my kids nap schedule. It is totally not conducive to outdoor play. Ryan goes down about 10-10:30 and sleeps until 2ish (I know, my kids are AWESOME nappers….3-4 hours is the norm, although Isabel is finally starting to outgrow it….wop wop), and Isabel goes down sometime between 1 & 2 and wakes up between 3 & 5. Then its dinner time. Sigh.
However, there have also been some very sinister noises amongst the squeaking, baying and clucking of the usual suspects. Amnesty International for one have declared that the referendum result is illegal and will have to be overturned either by the Swiss Supreme court or by the European Court of Human Rights . Meanwhile voices from within that bastion of ethical democracy the United Nations, have been making similar statements, whilst another paragon of Human rights, Turkey, has been calling on the Swiss government to “correct” the result.
Finally we have the Rimmel Lasting Finish Kate Lipstick in 04, the vampiest lipstick I own. This is a lovely deep blackened red-toned purple, and I enjoy playing up its undertones with different lipliners. Wear a purple lipliner or lipstain, it appears more purple. Wear a reddish or berry lipstain/lipliner, it appears more berry-toned. It can also look near black if you apply several layers, and the texture is thin but creamy. This is the deepest lipstick I've seen in the drugstore in these parts, and I have to applaud Rimmel for taking a risk with this shade!
Yes. That's it. I had guessed it was because they were afraid they'd lose their blessings that they turned to serve and worship other gods. Or that they'd grown lazy and self-confident, too busy or disinterested to seek for and do His will - why bother, things are going pretty well, right? Or maybe, I ventured, it was pressure to accommodate to the "foreigners'" ways (vendors, etc., in their midst) that always helped trip them up. And, I'm still guessing all these things contributed. I know I was guessing partly based on why I turn from God and His "right road" and head for other ways to try and satisfy myself. But here it is, in black and white, if not in bold, the real reason why they (and we) keep tripping up with regard to following God and seeking Him and His ways. Our hearts become prideful and forget Him and what He's done for us. Oh. I hate to think of myself that way. But I find it to be oh, so true in my own life, and probably for others, as well. We're not altogether different from one another in that way, after all.

From his mirror dangles a laminated photo of two children. The little girl looks out with huge, limpid brown eyes. I wonder about her. She’s wearing an orange butterfly clip in her thick, dark hair. I stare at it. A butterfly meant to be probing the heart of tiger lilies, meant to be ascending the sky in papery bursts, improbably strong. Will she find herself stretching, constrained, bound by glass walls she can’t escape?

The previous account I skimmed through, the one that pretended to be completely factual based on a mysterious ‘found’ manuscript, made no mention of this. It really puts some things in perspective, like how she could never compete with this mistress, his 34 year old mistress (he was only 14 at the time as well). Crazy. Imagine, your first time, at 14, with your father-in-law in the room, just to make sure it all works as it should. Really crazy.

I didn't sleep that night. I laid awake thinking of Marge and that needle and the little prick of blood it had induced. I wondered if Marge had killed me and if the disease was in my body. I imagined pink and blue things swirling about in my blood, attaching to things and duplicating themselves. I thought of those terrifying adverts from the mid 80's that was my generations equivalent to the thought of nuclear warfare. At gone 3am I was up and in a real state. At that lowly hour I called my good friend Verity and sobbed down a phoneline what had happened. Verity, a one time nurse, couldn't do much right then but arranged to come and meet me in the morning. Until then not even huge amounts of smack could calm me – my mind couldn't be subdued on this one. Me, a severe hypochondriac at the best of times. Even when healthy I was convinced I was dying of cancer, and now I'd been given good reason to believe I was really dying. Well, that was too good an opportunity for my body to turn down. And so it panicked away... all night fucking long.

Mein Kampf is banned in the Netherlands. France last week criminalized the denial of the Armenian genocide in Turkey (an act that resulted in widespread condemnation by the OIC, whose Secretary General, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, had the audacity, days after the ratification of 16/18, to bluster that those who defend cartoons that mock Mohammed as “freedom of thought and expression” have no business limiting the speech of those who deny the Armenian genocide. “This is an indisputable and unacceptable paradox,” he declared). And so on.

Text, by offering us control over our message, insidiously asserts its control over us. Naturally, text, the word, does not have a mind of its own. But remember this: word is power and power asserts its control over those who wield it. Think of people corrupted by unbridled power: Mugabe, Gaddafi, Museveni, and on and on. Power left unchecked manipulates, corrupts, and ultimately destroys those who try to use it.

Roberts frequently had suggested that boosters exercise too much power in college athletics, that they exploit athletes to massage their own egos or to advance agendas that contradict the goal of higher education. But for the lacrosse team, a different standard seemed to apply. Its 100 percent graduation rate, heavy representation on the conference academic honor roll, and many good jobs upon graduation could be construed by Roberts as a bad thing.

So, what we do basically nowadays is that we put a coin in it and the Chief of the family after making the sign of cross on the pie three times, starts to cut pieces and distribute them to each person around the table.

The worst thing is that all this focus on the weight of individuals is distracting us from the systemic issue of lack of access. Many people do not have access to the healthy foods that they would choose to eat -including foods that are not genetically modified or full of hormones or government subsidized high fructose corn syrup. Many people do not have access to safe movement options that they enjoy, or to affordable evidence-based health care. But as long as we focus on little Johnny’s BMI, we don’t have to address the real problems here and we can just keep shaming and blaming fat kids and adults and misinforming them and everyone else about the odds of becoming permanently thin.

Romney can't seem to stick to one side of any issue which means he'd be a puppet for stronger personalities (by stronger, I mean corporations with lots of money to donate, contribute, or just hand over). Romney claims to be some sort of wizard in the field of jobs creations, saying that's what he's been doing all his life. The reality is, Mitt buys companies in trouble, and tears them apart for resale. It's much like the character played by Richard Gere in Pretty Woman. Gere's company bought other companies and sold them off for parts, basically. Only in the movie, Gere realizes he isn't accomplishing anything, "We don't MAKE anything", he says; and he's right. Somehow, I don't think even a pretty hooker could make Romney have that sort of epiphany.
In Charles Little’s book among the notes he writes; ” As it happens, aluminum is a common constituent of forest soils almost every where, but it is locked up in aluminum silicates, and in this compound form is not available to trees and other plants, and therefore is no danger to them. But after acid rains come , the silicates were broken down, and the aluminum was freed to be taken up by trees and plants. The metal kills all roots first, this means that trees can no longer absorb and transport needed nutrients, such as phosphates, calcium, and magnesium-essential fertilizers that are themselves leached away from the soil by acid deposition, The trees are weakened and can be invaded by insects or pathogens or secumb to extremes of weather-or all of the above, in which case they die.” So dead grasses, dandelions, plants, weakened trees, beetles move in. I think years of contrails, and the more recent years of chemtrails has caused this reaction, and our trees are dying from it. Perhaps independent studies void of governmental duress, threats, manipulations, would show this with soil, water, and ring samples. I bet it would.
Has a Jesus-Demonstration-Sunday ever been tried before? Yes. A church in Nashville has a Jesus-Demonstration-Sunday, not just once a year, but every Sunday morning. This is called organic church and/or simple church. Here is their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=63112196944
For me that’s parenthood. Well at least, right now. It’s normal, I deal with it. I mean I’m not one of those baby mafia moms that go to the sandbox in their Gucci sunglasses, $1000-diaper bags, and fashion ensembles that make it look like they’re going clubbing. They sit there in their little pack chit-chatting about how their child was potty trained at 12 months, painted a masterpiece, is already reading at first-grade level, and never misbehaves when they know damn well that he’s the kid eating the sand and having tantrums in the car.
and I have been following each other for a while now. She lives in the beautiful city of Bellevue, Washington not far from where I will be moving to in the spring!

This week's episode was set in the week before Thanksgiving 1966, certainly a moment of great apprehension for many American housewives like the embittered Betty Francis (the artist formerly known as Betty Draper).
The book is all about different moods and the message of the book is to be happy hippo--not an angry duck! It's funny because even though it's a kids book, I actually took something away from it. This situation I'm in seems impossible sometimes, but it's really important that I act like a hippo and not a duck. I can't change what's happened and honestly I'd rather do this than have my girls in the NIQU, so I really have to try to maintain a positive outlook--even when I'm homesick and missing my husband more than anything.
Of course, now that I'm firmly entrenched in my adult years, I am more likely to whip up a batch of cookies than go the jar-and-spoon route. That does not, in any way, rule out helping myself to a little spoonful during the baking process.
I can honestly say I have been dreading this birthday for at least a year or 2. I am no longer going to be in my 20's now it's my 30's! How did that happen? I swear just yesterday I was dying to graduate high school & now 30! My hubby is a few years older than me so when he turned 30 & HATED it, I teased him relentlessly. Now my day has come, but I will continue to remind him he will always be older than me! :)
I’ve been reading this book called The Expectant Father. A lot of people seemed to recommend it, and there really aren’t a whole lot of baby books out there I’ve seen that are actually geared toward dads and how to prepare for a baby. Because, let’s face it, we’re not doing a whole lot of the work—aside from general fetching of things and talking to the baby, this is a process that’s completely out of our hands. I wanted to try to find something productive to do with the time that will actually help me be a decent dad.

While you're doing all that, you're going to want to soak your hardwood chunks in water (or beer?) for about half an hour. You want them to smolder, not burn. After half an hour, let them dry just a bit. You don't want to extinguish the coals with a dripping chunk of wood, that would be stupid.
We looked at each other, puzzled, as we struggled to understand the question. The nurse waited, offering no clue about what the correct answer might be.
It’s my understanding that many of us, especially those who’ve actually asked for it, “can expect” (1) to go through an opening or a transition in consciousness in the upcoming month. I say this because of a reading I had with Archangel Michael on April 25.

Muir-Wood’s paper was originally commissioned by Roger Pielke, professor of environmental studies at Colorado University, also an expert on disaster impacts, for a workshop on disaster losses in 2006. The researchers who attended that workshop published a statement agreeing that so far there was no evidence to link global warming with any increase in the severity or frequency of disasters.
The big news this morning has been all about the the fire that engulfed an old Lakeland building in Ash Street, Bowness-on-Windermere. Ash Street is a well-trodden cobbled street located in Bowness centre, just 2 minutes’ walk from our guest house, Blenheim Lodge. Yesterday, as we were driving out of Bowness to Edinburgh, we found ourselves being stopped by police from entering Lake Road (aka Craig Brow), the main thoroughfare in Bowness and Windermere, which leads to the A592. Police had cordoned off all roads leading into Bowness, except for access through windy country roads – what locals call the Crook Road.
And the rest of the weekend was filled with laughter, family, memories and smiles ~ lots of smiles as we finally were able to get family pictures taken (another part of their surprise). We had not had family pictures taken since I was a sophomore in college and they were for the church directory.
I have been test tatting several patterns for another tatter, so can't show that work.
Its green, dark green with dangerous granite mountains that block storms and cast shadows. Crystal rivers carve the dense valleys and rolling fields filling the wide blue lakes that shimmer like mirrors. Towering pines, birchs, oaks, maples and hemlocks sway in the unpredictable breeze, breaking the sunlight into warm silver beams that sparkle the dew-laden grass. The October landscape is changing. The green leaves are dying and turning to gold, ruby, amethyst, and garnet. The fallen leaves crunch under your feet and when you speak, you see your breath plume in front of you. Soon, the trees will be empty and bare, the ground will be white with snow and everything will be quiet, trapped in ice, asleep.

I thought I would start off nice and slow with this post and this onesie seems to fit the bill. I honestly can't get enough of the truly honest baby clothing out there in the world now (like the onesies about boobs and such). Why exclude the puke, eh?

“I mean, I have some junk in the trunk, if that’s what you’re asking. Child-bearing hips, that’s for sure,” was my response. I really wasn’t prepared to defend my body this morning – especially after spending the past week and a half eating and drinking whatever I wanted while I was on vacation.
I also suspected I knew the cause. Why would anyone borrow a 99 cent book when they could borrow a $9.99 one instead? Frankly, having 14 borrows surprised me. So I decided to try raising Seven's price to $2.99, both to see how it affected borrows and what it did to sales themselves.
I was tired of the old blog look, so I updated it to something completely different. I like it. It's the start of a new season, there are new beginnings in my life, and I'm back to simplifying quite a bit. It is definitely time for a change! I also have some exciting news to come in the next week.

But that said, I will also be taking a short blogging break for two or three weeks. One of my best friends is visiting me from Germany, and we have decided to head out into the Rockies for a road trip!

I understand that I am a woman, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have a job to do and, while it’s not much to brag about, I am damn good at my job. People may not see the harm in calling a woman in uniform “sweetie” or “darling,” and if you’re past middle age, I can forgive you for treating the younger world like they’re all your grandchildren, but if you’re middle-aged or younger, you can shove your demeaning “sweetheart”s up your ass. You don’t call a black man “boy” or “negro” because it says, “You are less of a person than I am.” Just because women might not kick your ass for being sexist or racist doesn’t make it okay. And I’m not stupid, no matter how many rich ass holes assume I am. I can tell the difference between “You have a great day, sweetie!” and “It’s been precious talking to you, but I’ve got important male things to attend to so open the damn gate, sweetheart.” I understand that there are differences in tone and inflection and underlying meaning, and I respond differently to differences in each. When it all comes down to it, I probably would have seethed about it for a few minutes and then let it go if I hadn’t gotten what were essentially two male point-of-view responses telling me I was being an over-emotional woman about it. No, I’m not. I’m being a human being about being treated like a lesser person.
There is that Pinterest thing again and so I had to go figure out what this is all about. I am by no means an expert as I have only been researching this for less than 24 hours. Here is what I found it. Pinterest is a site where people can ‘pin’ pictures of their favorite things to create boards that can be shared with other people on Pinterest. If you like to create vision boards or just collect favorite pictures that you find on the internet than this is a great site to collect everything in one place.
Contemporary poets such as Kevin Higgins can gather the new ‘ordinary plenty’ such as the happenings in President Clinton’s trousers and once-avidly-followed television programmes into a poem, ‘Remembering the Nineties’, that comments ironically on media changes experienced since the 90s; Leanne O’Sullivan can write an eloquent collection on the subject of anorexia and teenage anxiety. This is but a small sample of recent concerns. Irish poets are now less concerned with the notion of insularity and more involved in the global – but Irish poetry still has a particular feel to it; a touch of the lyrical that will always out. It is certainly a different kind of anthology that would be needed to showcase all the poetry flowing in Ireland in the present day, and it could be argued that the annual Best of Irish Poetry published by Munster Literature Centre since 06/07 already serves that purpose, or indeed some might look to The Echoing Years (2007) the third in a trilogy of anthologies that combined Irish and Canadian poetry.
User behaviour is a more accurate model for assessing new features, rather than marketing a prototype which requires written or verbal feedback; what users do is often more than what they say. Real time testing and split testing allows for greater reliability in the data also.

The furniture was comfortable. I was brought coffee on a silver tray with real half and half in a silver pitcher and sugar in a silver sugar bowl. They also had a tray of lovely pastries that were great to look at and very tasty. They started with this coffee ritual (as most of the Nordic countries do) and talked about personal things first. How was your trip? How do you like Helsinki? It was a totally different experience.

Urgency brought me to San Francisco and it has carried me up until the end of last year. To be clear, I do not associate having a family, children, and a good means of income with a representation of complacency – those aspects of life just seem to be a different set of goals that other people (not named me) were working on.
In an effort to put my research of app sources in one place (and to share them with you), I thought I'd run a few blog carnivals here over the next week or so. I'll start with math-related apps today, then feature other subject areas in future posts. I hope this compilation serves as a good resource for other parents like me who hope to make these technological tool-toys equally fun, functional and educational rather than the complete time-wasters they could easily become.

Holly on June 24 and Heather on August 13. It was truly the end of a long lifetime battle with disease. I hate Cystic Fibrosis. The disease makes mockery of those who have it. Although I can say, the girls had CF, but it didn’t have them. If you had asked anyone that I ever knew if they would have rather have been unborn, they would have told you “no”. As painful as life could have been for them, they would not have missed the experience of living for the world.
The key to the crunchy crisp skin is this secret ingredients...corn starch. What a valuable lesson I have learned from the Living Magazine! This is such a simple roast chicken that anyone can prepare. All you need to do is to wash and clean the whole chicken (believe it or not, this is a task that I took a while to pick up the courage to do!), pat it real dry, inside out, and rub some butter all over the skin, including under the skin. Butter will help the chicken to brown evenly. The next thing is to rub a combination of salt, pepper and corn starch all over the chicken, including the cavity and of course under the skin to add flavour to the meat. I like to add in some dried mixed herbs as I love the smell of the herbs when the chicken is roasting. It is perfectly all right to leave it out or you could do with some fresh rosemary (finely chopped). I don't truss the chicken as I don't know how to do it, plus, I think it is not an absolute must. The last step is to place it in a roasting pan (preferably one that comes with a rack, to encourage even browning) and leave it to the oven to the finish the job as it is not necessary to baste the chicken. In about an hour's time, you will be rewarded with a golden crispy chicken, not forgetting the inviting aroma of the roast chicken...I feel so proud for myself as I am very certain my neighbours could smell it and would probably think their neighbour must be a good cook!
There I was, browsing through Christian films (I do that every now and again). I found one gem, "Countdown to Armageddon", which was made in 1996. It's another one of those, "the world is more evil now than ever" productions. I was having a good old chuckle their take on the world as it was in 1996. They came out with things like Jamie Bulger's killing is a sign that the end is nigh. Then the topic of the Antichrist raised its horny head. The laughing stopped and I thought "holy shit", to myself. They had described the Antichrist just as you'd describe Barack Obama!

As a matter of interest, her view of our cops is that they are a “criminal enterprise renamed the South African Police Service — a mostly illiterate, ill-trained force, riven by feuds, fetishes, and factional loyalties” who are “seizing fire arms from law abiding citizens and selling them for profit to other criminals”.

So. Quit the blog. Tried to make real friends. Felt like I lost a few (due to my own reclusive nature and not keeping in contact via email and shit) Read a million books and tested out lots of crazy shit (some not so crazy, almost all super fun or incredibly interesting) Nearly blew up my brain and went to see a therapist (who helped me see why I had so much difficulty cultivating and keeping female relationships. HUGE huge work. Now I have a couple really real authentic friends and it feels really nice.) Thought maybe I would go back to college and get my masters degree in philosophy and signed up for some classes (Those just ended. The classes were not what I had hoped they would be BUT my professor was SO Great, this 70ish year old guy who had lived in New Orleans for about 40 years and was all into hypnotism and tarot cards and astrology and shit! We are friends now and meet up to discuss metaphysical matters and behavioral psychology. All I really wanted when I signed up for classes was to be able to shoot the shit with someone who had read and experienced WAY more than me so that worked out perfect.), then finally focused on strengthening my physical body and willpower through the fitness challenge, and now here I am. Beginning massage school.

Agreeably with this, we ought to understand that God, though He give not to our will, doth give for our salvation. For suppose the thing thou have asked be to thine hurt, and the Physician knows that it is to thine hurt; what then? It is not to be said that the physician does not give ear to thee, when, perhaps, thou askest for cold water, and if it is good for thee, he gives it immediately, if not good, he gives it not. Had he no ears for thy request, or rather, did he give ear for thy weal, even when he gainsaid thy will? Then let there be in you charity, my brethren; let it be in you, and then set, your minds at rest: even when the thing ye ask for is not given you, your prayer is, granted, only, ye know it not. Many have been given into their own hands, to their own hurt: of whom the apostle saith, “God gave them up to their own hearts’ lusts" (Rom 1:24). Some man hath asked for a great sum of money; he hath received, to his hurt. When he had it not, he had little to fear; no sooner did he come to have it, than he became a prey to the more powerful. Was not that man’s request granted to his own hurt, who would needs have that for which he should be sought after by the robber, whereas, being poor, none sought after him? Learn to beseech God that ye may commit it to the Physician to do what He knows best. Do thou confess the disease, let Him apply the means of healing. Do thou only hold fast charity. For He will needs cut, will needs burn; what if thou criest out, and art not spared for thy crying under the cutting, under the burning and the tribulation, yet He knows how far the rottenness reaches. Thou wouldest have Him even now take off His hands, and He considers only the deepness of the sore; He knows how far to go. He does not attend to thee for thy will, but he does attend to thee for thy healing. Be ye sure, then, my brethren, that what the apostle saith is true: “For we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered: for He maketh intercession for the saints" (Rom 8:26-27). How is it said, “The Spirit itself intercedeth for the saints,” but as meaning the charity which is wrought in thee by the Spirit? For therefore saith the same apostle: “The charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us" (Rom 5:5). It is charity that groans, it is charity that prays: against it He who gave it cannot shut His ears. Set your minds at rest: let charity; ask, and the ears of God are there. Not thatwhich thou wishest is done, but that is done which is advantageous. Therefore, “whatever we ask,” saith he, “we shall receive of Him,” I have already said, If thou understand it to mean, “for salvation,” there is no question: if not for salvation, there is a question, and a great one, a question that makes thee an accuser of the apostle Paul. “Whatever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do these things that are pleasing in His sight:” within, where He seeth.

While I was home my middle sister showed me a skin condition she developed after her health crisis a few years ago. She always had a little bit of it behind her ears like I do, dry skin and a little dandruff, more if we are stressed out. But now she has it all over her back and on the soft skin on her forearms. It looks like it hurts but she says it just itches. The dermatologists were shooting her up with steroids and giving her medicinal creams and nothing was working. One doctor would not even touch her he found her condition so disturbing. Nice. I took her to the health food store that opened up there a few years ago and bought her some flax seed oil caps and some calendula gel and some other stuff that might give her some relief.

I don’t know how having a child with Down syndrome has changed Kelle, because she doesn’t really ever say. Has she done a HUGE benefit to the Down syndrome community by showing that Down syndrome can be beautiful and that life can be good with Down syndrome? A resounding YES! And I thank her for that. But there’s more to this whole journey than just image – or at least I’d like to think so. People like to say in defense of Kelle that she was all sunshine and rainbows before Nella was born, and she’s still sunshine and rainbows – it’s not like she’s changed, for goodness sake! Yeah, that’s kind of a problem for me. Why isn’t she changed? Maybe she is. But she doesn’t tell us that.

As you would expect from the man who once embodied Seth Bullock, Raylan has a way with folks and sets about sorting out the problem the only way he knows how – with cool detachment and bottled in anger.
As a general rule, the offers you complete through Project Payday’s forum will pay more if they require you to make a payment upfront, and the more they cost you the better they will pay. You have to figure out for yourself how much a certain offer will cost and decide whether it is worth the amount you will get paid for the time it will take you.
We are starting off with bare bones in this room; a twin bed, a low shelf unit from Ikea, and a TON of toys!!! But I think with some of the things I plan on pulling from other places in the house and repurposing we will have a pretty easy time carrying out my vision.
For me, ISIS acts like an ultimate energy source. Sometimes I sit and listen and say to myself – this music could infuse the dead with enough focus and will to rise and live again. There is simply nothing I can picture that can seem daunting when I have ISIS for a soundtrack. The sheer might, the cascading energy emanating from their songs is just too much to allow for any sort of anxiety. I’ll never forget the way the vocalist would transform from one passage to the next in their live show. From a thin, quite-frail looking individual, he would grow two feet and simply project an unstoppable wave of force every time one of the more brutal vocal stretches came up in a song. It was during that show I felt that musicians don’t just pluck guitar strings – when they get it right, they start gaining access to some deeply ingrained musical instrument in their audience’s minds. Nothing new here, I realize, but it was ISIS that brought this old cliche into reality for me and made me see its completely true, if somewhat banal validity. And, just to bring home my point about their music being essentially intellectual, in spite of the obvious asperity, I remember a guy at the concert who was thoroughly inebriated, which is the norm at any other metal concert I ever witnessed. However, in this case, he was sticking out like a sore thumb, getting into everyone’s way, trying to start a mosh pit when nobody else felt the slightest urge to smack anyone else, except maybe for him. This isn’t aggressive music, it’s purging – it’s no more aggressive than putting disinfectant on a wound – the same sort of sensory overload and the same sense of cleanliness are the only things left behind after listening to them, at least in my case. The drunken troublemaker was thus quickly ejected from the room and I could see tranquil smiles all around once he was gone.
If it is understood that the political aspect of Islam preceded the religious aspect, that might change. But that will happen only if a sufficient number of people are willing to go wherever the truth my take them.
6. The Islamic century - Neo-Barbarism and Chaos, the new Dark Ages
It is important that this report be evaluated hand in hand with the latest DOE Integrated Database Report (US Spent Nuclear Fuel And Radioactive Waste Inventories, Projections and Characteristics), referred to as IDB in the following comments. High-level waste inventories in the IDB are noted as of Dec. 31, 1994 at 958.8 million curies at only 4 specific locations: Savannah River, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Hanford and the former West Valley, New York reprocessing site. In view of the missing inventories of spent fuel and high-level waste discussed elsewhere in this section of RADNET, it is essential that the following footnote on page 15 in the IDB be noted by anyone concerned about the environmental remediation of source points of radioactive contamination documented in this report: “DOE IS UNDERTAKING SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO BETTER DEFINE THE VOLUMES AND TYPES OF WASTES CURRENTLY IN STORAGE AT ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION SITES AND THOSE WHICH MAY BE GENERATED DURING FUTURE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE DOE COMPLEX. THIS INFORMATION, WHICH SHOULD BECOME AVAILABLE IN A FEW YEARS, WILL BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS REPORT.” (pg. 15). This means that the inventories of high-level waste (958.8 x 106Ci), transuranic wastes (2.67 x 106Ci), and low-level waste (23.5 x 106Ci) listed in the IBD DO NOT INCLUDE THE HUGE VOLUMES OF UNCONTAINED WASTES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION GENERATED AND DISCHARGED at the many DOE environmental restoration sites listed in this publication.

I picked up some thin cork sheets from Michael's and cut them into strips. I glued the strips onto the edges of the tile using E-6000 glue (that stuff is amazing!).

I have to say, right off the bat this book intrigued me. Duff. I'd never heard the word before but after learning it's meaning, it is definitely something that I could see myself, and many other teen girls (and boys) relating too. Besides that though, the plot sounded really good so after hearing some positive buzz about the book, I decided to pull it from my bookshelf and read it.

I recently had a dream of death. A nameless malady was afoot: it caused people to become drowsy; if they fell asleep, they died. I contracted the malady. I felt myself getting sleepy. I knew what would happen if I gave in to sleep. I was frightened. Yet, there was part of me that thought that giving in might not be such a bad thing: after all, it was only endless sleep that awaited me. The most vivid feature of the dream was the choice that I faced: to wit, the emotion involved in the pull between the fear of extinction and the release of just letting go.
Middlebury is magnificent. The only drawback is the location-far from NYC. Otherwise everything was PERFECT. I loved it. I instantly worshipped the school. I wanted Elsa to accept very badly. Everything was going well, except for our meeting with the soccer coach. We dropped in on him unexpectedly, with no appointment. He was amazingly gracious. He's a lovely man and most likely a very good coach, but he was clearly not interested in Elsa as a potential player at all. He knew nothing about her! Accepting the Posse would have meant Elsa giving up soccer, or playing JV. After so many years of training and preparing, this news was a huge and insulting disappointment and one that Elsa chose not to accept. So that was it.

Paul clearly shows that they had received a “raising up”, paralleled after Christ’s resurrection, while still in the flesh by means of their mortal bodies being made alive by means of the spirit. Clearly the reference here to being made alive did not refer to an actual resurrection since they were still alive. This was a current condition and is what Paul was describing in Romans 8:11.

Immediately, I decided I wanted to do something scientific or medical related instead, and being really into the TV show CSI at the time Forensic Science was appealing, but also Medicine as due to my families multiple medical problems I had been learning a lot about several medical conditions (cardiology and neurology mainly). Strange thing about this career choice was that I had ‘hated’ science at school, and I also had a problem of fainting at the sight of blood… Still, I enrolled on a Biology A Level course. Part way through the course I gained my first ‘real’ job which just happened to be as a Casework assistant for the Forensic Science Service (my dream job at the time…). I hadn’t been in the job 6 months before I went off ‘sick’ with stress and depression (It was actually a BPD crisis, but I was undiagnosed at this point). I left the job in the end due to pressures at home.
When I was small my teachers used to put topper’s first and all other students were worthless in their eyes, it was likely that most of us developed a low self-esteem because of this. We felt that we were not as good as them because teachers disliked us and mocked us often. It was hurtful and destructive for a child’s growth. I started believing that I was not good enough because I could not keep my teachers happy and same applied to parents..I developed this pattern of crying over negative happening’s and rejoicing over positive happening’s.

Drop all the unpeeled cloves into boiling water for no more than a minute, to loosen the skins. Drain and cool enough to handle, then peel. Heat 1 cup of apple cider vinegar in a pan with a good pinch of saffron and a tablespoon of sugar. Boil for a couple of minutes. Put the garlic cloves into jars with some fennel seeds, peppercorns and a bay leaf. Pour over the hot vinegar to cover the garlic and seal. That's it..... Bon appetit!
A few days later, after sending the letter to the fair-haired boy and excitedly claiming he "looked" at him during breakfast, George spots a crow flying over the blue sky, which he says to William is bad luck. Sure enough, later that afternoon, George is knifed in the showers by McArdle, who flees the scene while William screams for help. A guard comes onto the scene and orders William and others to line up and face the wall.

Finally, “coordinated”? Few public policy efforts have ever had the massive institutional and financial coordination that the climate change cause enjoys. That tiny Heartland, with but a single annual conference and a few phone-book-sized reports summarizing the skeptical case, can derange the climate campaign so thoroughly is an indicator of the weakness and thorough politicization of climate alarmism.

The organized disobedience of 1899 was only the grandest of New York's newsboy strikes. Despite their youth and inexperience, newsies fought back on several occasions throughout the late 19th century. While the image of the street-smart, scrappy whelp was a stereotype often relayed by the newspapers themselves, in some cases, journalism's youngest workforce used its hot-blooded pluck to great advantage.
Neither the archivist nor the inquisitor notice anything untoward, right up until the power were the flaming skeletons rise up from the water to assault them both.

On Human Ebay there’s an option to click on “what you’re looking for”. There’s nothing along the lines of “Let’s see how it goes shall we?” The choices are Long Term (hmmm, Fatal Attraction again), Activity Partner (um….what kind of activity? ), Intimate Encounter (ah, the last one obviously means sport of some kind, definitely not ticking that one. What’s this intimate encounter though? Would any woman in her right mind admit this unless she was touting for business at Ipswich Docks?), Hang Out (What does that mean exactly? Isn’t that what teenagers do in bus shelters? Would I need to turn up with 10 B&H and a pack of Haribos?) The last category was Dating (that’s what I put, seemed the most reasonable given that I didn’t fit any of the other categories and hopefully it would cover all eventualities).

When this now historic comic appeared fifty years ago it looked great, it was an example of the wonders of commercial printing. In those days the artist would send in their artwork usually on board and it would be photographed and the transparencies would be the source of the plates used to print his artwork using four runs (sometimes more) which would print a sequence of dots in 1). Cyan 2). Magenta 3). Yellow and 4). Black. By the time Commando number four was printed the whole process was pretty refined and misalignments creating out of register prints were the exception rather than the rule.

So the cute little kitty is the newest animal dumped at our house. Someone put her in a box and left her in our driveway. She was very scared when Mom brought the box inside (thinking that it was one of Granddad's or Uncle Andrew's boxes) and opened it to find a tiny little fluffy kitten. She was a little bit skinny and scared of Lola and I.
I assured her that we could wait until tomorrow. I knew this because my step mom had already decided that no matter what the doctors said, she wasn’t taking dad off of life support until my brother got here from California.
He highlights a connection between the French knight and the Crusaders who sacked Constantinople in 1204. “And we have a description of a cloth, that sounds very like the Shroud, that had been seen before that in Constantinople, described as the burial cloth of Jesus, that then goes missing and is never heard of again.” So, de Wesselow’s theory is that it was taken to France by the Crusaders as looted bounty.

His dangerous and desperate flip-flopping has him so coated in Santorum that he’s adopting the most far-right talking points as his campaign positions, no matter how illogical or unpopular. The terrifying example that wins him this week’s award is a single sentence from a campaign stop, bizarrely included in a discussion of budget cuts: “Planned Parenthood, we’re going to get rid of that.” REALLY? Let’s set aside for a moment that this is an independent organization, not a Federal program, so any attempt to “get rid” of it is anti-business (ironic much?). Far more terrifying is that the putative front-runner for President in one of our two major parties has officially endorsed the war on women. The Romneyborg wants us ignore the fact that the vast majority of the services Planned Parenthood provides are critical women’s health care to poor and rural women. He has become so extreme in his eagerness to clinch the nomination that he’s endorsing the radical anti-contraception position that the vast majority of Americans (including Catholics and all Republicans other than the Tea Party) oppose. This candidate’s dizzying spin might provide a great alternative energy source; in every other respect it just induces nausea–yes, I will have to spit up after publishing this.
Still, that sort of ethical clarity—so obvious to most Americans in the 1930s—is apparently far from obvious to a great many Americans today. The speculative bubbles of the last decade, again, offer an uncomfortably clear look at the popularity of delusion in American public life just now. When John Kenneth Galbraith wrote his brilliant and very funny history The Great Crash 1929 back in 1954, he noted that the best preventive for the miserable economic aftermath of a speculative bubble was a clear memory of just how miserable that aftermath had turned out to be. In 1954, he was quite correct; a generation raised in the Depression years kept Wall Street on a very tight leash back then, and indeed Galbraith’s own testimony before a Senate subcommittee in 1955 on the implications of the 1929 experience was enough all by itself to pop a stock market boomlet—a circumstance Galbraith recounted in wry terms in the foreword to the second edition. The memory of 1929 had an immunizing effect so potent that it took until the 1960s for the US stock market to blow its first very tentative bubbles, and it wasn’t until the mid-1980s that a really classic stock market boom and bust followed the traditional path, up with the rocket and down with the stick.

They have had the chance to figure out what type of learning works best for who they are as individuals. Honestly, they have done quite well without "research" getting in the way.

In infants, lung function testing requires sedation so the child sleeps and is passive during the test. This allows the infant PFT equipment to perform testing since the child is not old enough to cooperate with PFTs. Infant PFTs can be performed very early in life until about 2 to 4 year of age depending on the equipment and size of the child.

The front line council staff, the care home workers, the administrators, the street cleaners etc. as well as probably most of the middle managers would simply be employed by the Assembly instead of the current 22 authorities. There would be job losses among the senior management, but as these are the very people who are protecting their own, very generous, salaries and pensions by slashing the pay, conditions and jobs of their (already far lower paid) subordinates, I have pretty much no sympathy for them.
Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't also give credit due to all the 'starving artists' who took up residence in the reclaimed mills around town.

The Bagman is one Frank "Mac" McCullough, a one-time courier and thug for a crime family during the First Great Depression. At an early age Mac's life took a major turn when he became an orphan, spent time in a reformatory, and then later got involved in the rackets. But he's always had a core of decency and honesty buried in his heart. So when he chooses to help and old family friend who got in hock to the Mob, Mac turns his back on crime and his Boss, Slots Lurie, and suddenly finds himself taking another turn on the road of life. In a last-minute decision to conceal his identity from the wiseguys he's hunting, Mac dons a paper bag over his head, and soon he's known as the mysterious Bagman. (Later he acquires a mask more appropriate to being a man of mystery, crime-fighting avenger.) And then, in the first part of this origin story, he becomes a fugitive wanted by both the Mob and the police.

I think I found my new favorite author. Kristin Hannah made me laugh, and cry, and laugh some more. Amidst grief and suffering, her words connected fluidly allowing the reader to dive deep into the characters souls.
And yet, Turner told NPR’s Allison Aubrey he expects people will continue to take echinacea. “I’ve given up a long time ago with trying to convince people that science should dictate how they behave,” he said. “And so I don’t imagine that the people who are convinced that echinacea works for them are going to be swayed one way or another by the results of our study.”

While our heat was out and we were using the fireplace I managed to either pull or sprain a muscle in my side. Painful! I used the heating pad every chance I got and I know everyone got tired of listening to my low moans and sudden yelps of pain. I was not able to do anything, even stitching, because any type of movement seemed to set off another pain and scream!

Rane is such an evil, criminal mastermind of great skill that he has managed to put his own people aboard the plane. In a matter of minutes once the plane takes off, his guys kill both FBI agents and take over the plane. It's then up to Cutter to take back the plane and capture Rane, with only a stewardess to help him out. In the course of the movie, Cutter will jump out of a moving plane, punch a French guy in the throat, hit that French ponytail wearing bastard with a golf club in the balls, ride a motorcycle dangerously (why of course), beat up some redneck cops, and deliver some classic one-liners.
Just some "deconstructed" Thanksgivingish things I looked at on the web for inspiration to serve with the green-chile stuffing that I'm definately going to make. Thought it would be fun to do one deconstructed dish but haven't decided on anything in particular yet. I guess soup is easiest.

The counter-genocide on the Hutu in the Congo by Rwandan troops that spearheaded Laurent Kabila’s rebel troops spread and entrenched this madness, which, according to this report, has even contaminated the Pygmies, who used to be ranked by anthropologists as belonging to the category of “peaceful communities”: “Even the pygmies (or Mbuti tribe), long known for their relatively peaceful demeanor and pacific philosophies, have been drawn into the violence. Their once seemingly idyllic life in the Ituri forests (…) has been slowly transformed at least partly by their painful absorption into more urban settings, and marked by abuse, exploitation, and profound ethnic discrimination. The team discovered that under the cloak of war-induced chaos in North Katanga and other areas, Pygmy men have finally begun to fight back, and are said to be responsible for raping and pillaging Bantu villages-- allegedly with the encouragement of Rwandans - in retaliation for decades of abuse.”
But if THAT wasn’t ludicrous enough for you, apparently McLeod can bring back the dead Sean Connery by just…shouting his name at the sky, as he returns like he never got killed by The Kurgan in the flashbacks of the first movie. He interrupts a performance of Hamlet and doesn’t seem to realize it’s a show:
One of the reasons Deschutes has given for halting production of Cinder Cone is that it’s one of their least popular seasonals. So I found it a bit ironic that Drink Hacker rated Cinder Cone higher than its replacement Red Chair NWPA.

Mr. Ahmed Faiyaz’s “Across The Seas” leaves you dewy eyed. It’s very important to acknowledge the sacrifices of our dear ones and near ones made with a view to providing us a good future. He has done so in style. “Good Morning Nikhil” captures the pride of a father of a new born son who tends to invoke childhood memories. “It’s All Good” and “Ready, Jet Set Go!” are a commentary on contemporary India. How everybody wants to chase success sans inner peace. The style is simple and the lucidity of his prose leaves you spellbound.

The one thing that disappoints me is that the potency has changed. It's now absolutely identical to Bath & Body Works Glow & Steady in both texture and potency. This is not necessarily a bad thing on its own; Glow & Steady is one of my favorite gradual self tanners. The problem is that the original Bare Bronze came in two concentrations, and the Medium/Deep was nearly as powerful as a full strength tanner. This new Beach Sexy gets you tan, but not as quickly as the old one (it comes in only one concentration).
Christina wiped her legs as she explained to the guests how Etta James was the one singer she aspired to be like. Afterward, Christina delivered a heartfelt vocal tribute to Etta as she belted the Etta’s signature tune “At Last” that was by far one of the best deliveries of the iconic song I’ve ever heard. Unfortunately, mother nature paid Christina a visit at one of the wost times ever! On stage, in front of everyone, in a skirt.

So while it no longer makes sense to be short bonds (as Gross has figured out the hard way), what makes sense is to be very, very long duration, since this is what the Fed will be buying in Operation Twist/Torque. Enter Exhibit A – the chart of maturity/distribution of PIMCO holdings, of which most notable is the explosion in average holding duration, which from 4.56 in July, has soared to 6.27 in August, the highest since 6.23 in October, and possibly the highest on record (that said our records only go back to 2007). As part of this expansion, Gross has seen his Mortgage Securities soar to $78.5 billion, the highest since February, when Gross was actively reducing his MBS holding profile, and now is doing the opposite, and is accumulating Agency paper hand over fist in an attempt to extend duration. Bottom line: Pimco is now balls to the wall in the QE3 camp, first to be manifested by Operation Twist, and then, likely by outright Large Scale Asset Purchases. Look for numerous other copycat investors to expand the duration of their fixed income holdings from 4-5 to over 6.

The comments that you have left on my recent posts, I've read over and over again. They have given me strength and the love that I was so thirsty of during some of my lowest points. Your tweets made me smile even at times when I felt that the last thing I wanted to do was smile. The outpouring of emails and direct messages I had received from some of you, offering me shoulders to cry on, listening ears, precious times out of your busy schedules to let me know that you cared. Even when I had been quite MIA lately, many of you continued to pay me a visit through my blog just to check on how I was doing.

The estimates for heavy drinking follow a similar pattern. When using the heaviest drinking day in the last week measure, heavy drinking is defined as exceeding twice the Government daily benchmarks on a single day: more than 8 units of alcohol on that day for men and consuming more than 6 units on that day for women. The proportion of men drinking more than 8 units on their heaviest drinking day fell from 23 per cent in 2005 to 19 per cent in 2010. The corresponding estimates for women drinking heavily (more than 6 units) were 15 per cent in 2005 and 13 per cent in 2010.
All that being said, the novella holds promise. I enjoyed it in spite of (and sometimes for) its flaws, though I admit to laughing at times when I was supposed to be pained or titilated. I honestly believe that another draft could have fixed many of the problems.

Much of the Muslim world is completely unaware of Saudi Arabia’s blatant collusion with enemies of Islam, due primarily to the massive propaganda campaign that the state has maintained over the century, through the monopolization of Islamic literature. Instead of dropping bombs, what if we literally dropped literature containing the truth? Let the people decide their fate, not bombs? Is this such a radical idea?

Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.

He also acquires a magnificent black horse named Destiny, who reminded me slightly of the old Champion, the Wonder Horse TV shows, which were still being repeated on Saturday mornings when I was Sam's age. I can't remember much about them now except for the theme tune ("Champierrrnnnnnnnnn, the Wonder Horse...") and the fact that the excitement promised by the title sequence (all indians, stage-coaches and galloping horses) was never really delivered by the show itself. The Cowboy Jess books avoid this pitfall with carefree ease; they are all indians, stagecoaches and galloping horses. For older readers they may not have the same depth or scope of Geraldine McCaughrean's longer books, (and clearly aren't meant to) but they are still well worth reading, if only so that we can marvel at her nimble storytelling and the brilliance of her language (at one point, when dawn breaks after a night on the range, she describes a band of light appearing along the horizon 'as if the sky was lifting its hat to a lady'). For boys and girls who love adventure they are just about perfect. Order them now and encourage a bit of half term/summer holiday reading.

Operationally, academics approach change as if it was but one of many options, and clearly the least desirable of the bunch. The approach to change is tentative and requires extensive consultation on everything, including the method of consultation. A sense of urgency is seldom a factor in the equation. Risks are assumed only inadvertently, the consequences of urgency ignored.
Of course there's a demand for such units. The question is whether there would be less demand market-rate rental units, which would rent for $45/sf (or $2677/month for 714 sf, as FCR once projected) in 2011.

Mainstream, traditional flipped-classroom advocates would have students doing their ‘homework’ in class time, assisted by their teacher who is now untethered from the whiteboard and able to work one-to-one with students, each completing individual self-paced work. It does make sense. If they are going to be completing individual homework anyway, this is better than doing so alone at night when there is no help available when they are stuck.

I realize that Heracles’ story is very long, adding his and other stories would make the book huge, and apparently that’s not what Evslin was going for. Which is what sucks, because I loved the stories so much, and the way Evslin told them, that I really wanted a lot more.

"Anne Eliza was surrounded by 'cultured' women, and she described her home as a 'literary center.' Her aunts contributed to magazines like Godey’s Ladies Book and The Ladies Repository. Poet and editor (The New World) Park Benjamin was a guest, as was writer and editor (The Home Journal ,which became Town & Country) N.P. Willis. Willis’s sister, Fanny Fern — novelist, essayist and children’s story writer — also visited often. Anne Eliza was acquainted with literary figures like Catherine Sedgwick, Washington Irving and William Cullen Bryant."Anne Eliza left Brooklyn soon after her own education was finished and eventually married and settled in Ohio.

It's been a somewhat eventful number of months since last I posted here. This site as you can see, though, has not been very eventful.

I suspect each and every novel I write will take on a life of its own, which is a good thing, but also means the process won't ever look exactly the same.

One of her sisters tattled on her while I was blow drying my hair, and I was eager to just finish the process so I just said it was ok. Later on though I discovered that Rachel herself loves the iphone camera a little bit. She had take over 40 pictures, mainly of herself in about a 5 minute time span. Oh yes, she likes the camera.

(NOTE: At this point, in the summer of 2010, my uncle, my dad's identical twin is dying, and I'm shuttling to Chicago every weekend to help take care of him, I'm fucking up the first draft of the Semiotext(e) book, and the blog turns into a short, clipped journal of sorts, for the most part, with occasional essays. At this point I also start to question the blog constantly.)
In addition to this, after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, evidence confirmed that Russian scientists had been extensively researching Tsunami bomb technology during the Cold War to destroy large areas of Southern England and Holland whilst avoiding the problems of radiation fall out created by a nuclear attack.

It's good to see that there are some sane judges left in Australia. Most are liberal and criminals are either released or get soft sentences so they can re-offend and be found not guilty over and over. The judge in this case, Mark Dean, seems to have had enough of people using their culture as an excuse to commit violent crimes. The Afghan man who raped a teenager and then went on to rape another woman 5 days later, has been sentenced to 14 years in jail. The man, who is a 'traumatised Muslim Afghan refugee' and has been in Australia since 2001 committed his crimes in 2009 and then went on to blame his cultural differences for the attacks. Apparently his Muslim culture in Afghanistan condones rape of non-Muslim women? Not sure which culture he thinks gives him the right to prey on women, but at least this judge called him on his BS argument and now he's off to jail where he belongs. However, he'll only get to serve just under 8 years before he is eligible for parole. The article notes that he will most likely be deported back to Afghanistan on his release, but I tend to differ. We have seen numerous cases in Australia where these criminals have used our lax political correct Western laws to stay in the country for decades, fighting their deportations - all on the tax payers dime. I would be surprised if this man is sent back to the sandpit he comes from, but stranger things have happened!

Thursday afternoon was pretty much like any other day at my house. Until my husband woke up at 4pm and confessed to me that he had some chest pain, and that it had been going on for about a week. But that the previous night at work he had a pretty terrible "episode" which lasted a few minutes and scared both him and the co-worker who was there at the time. The only reason he told me anything at all was that it had gotten to the point where he felt he needed to see a doctor about it and he asked me to call and make an appointment.

Thanks to Tim Challies and my new iPod touch, I was looking for new RSS feeds and I found some. One of them was Parchment and Pen. Well, they started a new series just as I was tuning in called Why I Am/Am Not a Charismatic. I’ve been interested in that for a while. Well, they also have a podcast that I didn’t know about before called Theology Unplugged and they are covering the series as a conversation in that too. What I like about it that is conversational like Connected Kingdom with Tim Challies and David Murray.
As for this week we've got a full brewing schedule which will include our new session pales 'Polestar', 'Ensign' & 'The Benz'.
Breakdown by country of origin? As usual, the USA was the big winner here. I think I watched far fewer foreign films this year than in years past. 71 American films, not counting hybrids like the US/India The Namesake or US/UK Children of Men. The UK was the runner-up, with 8. Ouch - that's a pretty big gap. I didn't find myself as interested in films from Asia this year as I have in years past - perhaps I'm a bit burnt out. Two Korean films, a couple of Chinese (Hong Kong actioners, really), and just one or two Japanese films. In the past, these have been pretty big numbers. It's interesting to see how much I'm trending towards America and Europe these days. Of course, since so many films are produced by multiple countries - Japan, France and the US for Marie Antoinette for example - it's getting more difficult to categorize according to national origin.

Alcoholic drinks cover a huge spectrum of different tastes, and many don’t really taste “of alcohol” at all. For example, I recently tried some alcoholic root beer which was impossible to distinguish from the soft drink version. Have they really tried everything from Liebfraumilch to cask-strength Laphroaig and decided that nothing appeals? People may be vegetarian on principle, but you never hear them claiming that they don’t like the taste of meat, especially when it spans such a wide range of flavours from venison to oysters. Non-drinkers would be respected more if they were honest about their motivations.
On top of that, once I returned to Dijon, I soon found a shop that sold coffee and tea items. There, in the display window, I saw one of your siblings. And he was cheaper than you.
If nothing else, this whole experience will replace the golf course for me as a source of writing fodder.

The education Guardian on Monday June 25, 2007 told us the other part of the political elite the Conservative party ”announced last month that if it won the next general election there would be no return to grammar schools on the grounds that they do little to benefit children from poorer backgrounds. Instead, the party has promised to continue Tony Blair's flagship education reform and support the expansion of the academy schools programme - independent state schools sponsored by business.”We must counter these attempts to destroy our children by cultural Marxists. Parents must take back responsibility for their sons and daughters from the state. We need to re-introduce grammar Schools or even found new public schools to impart traditional values like honour, duty and service; others must consider Home Schooling networks to give their young the standard of education the state schools are denying them and to instil self-worth and a sense of belonging instead of teaching them to give up their country to outsiders and to become sexual perverts. We must revive local fairs and festivals and develop our Folk music traditions by taking traditional forms but using words and sentiments suitable for our present time to express our sufferings under the elites. These are not rationalist formulae but suggestions for our creative young people to develop in practice. They will forge natural, emotional bonds with their own people, their traditions and civilisation.

A note on the weather: Before the start it was pleasant. Probably too warm for running but given that we stood there for 30+ minutes it was comfortable. As soon as we started running, it was HOT. There was NO wind. My God, I live in Oklahoma, it’s windy as hell and there is NO wind? How? Why?

Remember the little sweet innocent boondoggle bracelet worker girl? Well she helped me again, but even after the 15 minute heart to heart we had earlier when she gave me the computer play by play of her log in issues, she looked at me a little confused and asked, "Have I ever helped you before?" "Um, yeah. You did actually." She then smiled and asked what she could do to help me. She looked up my prescription and said it would be done in about 40 minutes and if that would be okay. I told her I had to get to a meeting in about 20 minutes and if there was any way that it could be filled by then. After asking, her whole expression changed as her smiled disappeared into a cold grimace as she looked at me like I had just told her that I had kidnapped her mother. Even her tone went cold as she muttered; "Take a seat. If they finish early... I'll call your name."

Manuel, or Manny as he was called by anyone who had known him for more than about three minutes, was a naturally friendly guy who also happened to be a very deadly Army Ranger and Chinese linguist. There were easily a dozen souls who had left this earth shortly after seeing Manny’s teeth flash in what they thought was a friendly grin. Manny’s natural ability to connect with people had made him a lethal combination of cobra and teddy bear. As a backup to his ability to get information from informants through positive means, Manny had also developed a full suite of less pleasant interrogation skills. Manny had established himself as the go-to guy, before the crash, when his unit needed information from anyone that spoke Cantonese or Mandarin. Manny had proven his value once again as the Chinese U.N. troops advanced into Georgia.

The takeaway: Denial almost always makes consumers believe others’ disability risk is higher than their own. However, consumers who knew someone who had experienced a disability rated their own risk as higher.

Try to think back to yesterday and see if you can recall everything you ate and drank. Every little taste, bite, snack, or sip that crossed your lips. Chances are you’d probably forget an item or two, and most likely underestimate what you consumed. That’s pretty normal in today’s society where we’re constantly eating on the go or dining with distractions. Seldom do we sit down at a table and spend 20-30 minutes solely focused on enjoying our meals without the T.V., computer, tablet, phone, or road diverting our attention.
You see, if we look at the verse quoted above, we see that “God gave Himself absolutely.” When we abandon ourselves, we do the same for him, with no calculations. No, I have not reached this point yet. I don’t think I’m even close. But I’m reaching for it.
This idea is something I really need to try, especially for those shirts I accidentally put in the dryer. They end up being just a little too tight and they don't stretch out enough. This is from Craftster.
Wow it is already mid way through February and I have still been super busy. Since the beginning of the year we have managed to move house (finally it has settled and is our house)... I am back doing my day job which I love and still have yet to do much stamping on metal... (my other love).

Yes, another Modcloth remake! This dress is so sweet and light, and looks so easy to re-create! I've already found the perfect doilys off Etsy, and I just got a nice soft cotton/bamboo fabric, in light sage green. I'll probably use a burdastyle pattern I already have, for a simple tunic dress. This one's next on my list! Any ideas for a better name?

The next evening we went up to visit our upstairs neighbors. This makes our building sound absurdly cozy. The truth is, that while there are only five apartments, and we're friendly all around, we don't socialize all that much. Still, we have a lot in common with the folks upstairs, and when we do see them, even for a short stairway conversation, I always think that we should spend more time hanging out.
Were we going to the woods to beat drums? Do primal scream therapy? Whine endlessly about how our dads did or didn't treat us as kids? Not at all.
Just a mention before you go (If you haven’t already). Following the next two weeks I will be starting a full-time career as an illustrator at an animation company and thus will have less time to be blogging everyday, which I suppose hasn’t really been happening already. (congrats old man) Maybe no large difference in the end.
With 2011 underway there seems little in the way of good news to cheer most Greeks. Repeated increases in VAT, road tolls, ulitility and fuel bills, public transport combined with spiralling unemployment and shrinking wages have made people both angry and weary. The list of social and economic changes being pushed through parliament by the ruling PASOK government has left voters dazed.
I know plenty of folks who keep a regular schedule of cleaning, so that never is there a time when they look up to discover mounds of clothes on the bedroom floor, crumbs and detritus collecting around kitchen floor crevices, dishes in the sink, hair and splash stains around bathroom sinks and mirrors. No, they never let it get to that point. I do, however. It upsets me, but I guess not enough to reform me into a domestic do-gooder. I’m sorry honey, but I’m never going to be that kind of wifey.

Today’s digital photo frames are beyond anything most of us could have imagined just a few years ago. Riding in the car with family members I mentioned digital frames and no one knew what I was talking about. I wasn’t surprised because I had never heard of them either. We have not been living under a rock.
A bit earlier, I mentioned Maths, and how EEVL expanded to include that subject when we joined the RDN. When it comes to information resources, maths is a peculiar subject. What we found was that the EEVL Internet resource catalogue was fairly good at directing non-mathematicians towards quality maths resources, but almost completely useless at directing mathematicians towards relevant resources.
The dogs are still tired after all their activity today which is good for me as they aren’t whining to go out. Isabel came out and ate some of their food so threw up gross stuff instead of her normal dry vomit. Ugh. I get so tired of cleaning up after the animals some times. Soon as the weather stays nice for a longer period of time, I’m going to cut Bennie’s hair way down because he sheds so badly. Isabel sheds a lot too despite brushing her.

But at this stage in the game, there is little doubt (at least in my mind) that marriage will ultimately open up to include people of the same sex, and that this evolutionary advance will affect every area of family law and every nook and cranny of community life. If gay men can now get married in Iowa, nothing can stop it. It’s like a strapping, corn-fed freight train, roaring wholesomely past the amber waves of grain and purple mountain majesties on its way to the coastal American Sodoms. It’s Iowa that is delivering same-sex marriage to San Francisco and New York, not the other way around. The old American image of the family is being carried away; a new one is coming over the horizon, but we’re not there yet. The journey is changing us—all of us, Red and Blue alike—in ways that no one could anticipate.

This is a lesson that has been reinforced to me hard recently, as I have been moved to a part of town I am very unfamiliar with. Sometimes the maps (whether hand drawn, or GIS) is not enough. This (hypothetically of course) could lead to you running a fire in your second due and not knowing 100% were you are going and ending up 2nd due. Sure you still get to do some good fireground work but you should have been on the initial attack line and….well Im rambling and this in no way really happened (lol).
Finally we thought we had better inquire whether or not mother had been able to get a boat. We went into the hall and happened to meet the chief dining-room steward. He told us that he had just seen my mother, and that she had not yet been put into a boat. We found her, and were told that they were loading the forward boats on the port side from the deck below. The ship had a substantial list to port, which made quite a space between the side of the ship and the life boats, swinging out over the water, so the crew stretched folded steamer chairs across the space, over which the people were helped into the boats. We proceeded to the deck below. Father, mother and the maid went ahead of Long and myself.

In the space of four weeks, I have come to love my group of kids. They're a mixed lot, there's no doubt. But at the end of my two days with them, I always find it hard to switch off. One of them asked me the other day why I "only" work two days a week (and I graciously refrained from pinging them on the issue of unpaid Mummy work). I replied that in a perfect world, I would be able to bring my two baby girls with me into the classroom. But if I worked any more than I did, I would miss Phoebe and Maisie too much. The little girl who had asked me the question nodded, and seemed satisfied with my answer.

Anyhow, I'm trying to read twice as many books from my own shelves as I read from the library, so there's only one adult book from the library this week (I'm not counting children's books in this reading challenge). Since this book by S. J. Watson wasn't originally on my list for the 2012 Spring Reading Thing, that means I'll have to read a couple of extra books to "make up" for checking out this one. But it was worth it. As you can see, I've already finished the book and rated it 9 of 10 because it's an excellent book.

Indie vs Traditional: When it comes to reading and reviewing books, we don’t discriminate between independently published eBooks, small press printings, and traditional on-the-shelf novels. If it catches our attention, we’ll give it a go. What this means, though, is that we have the same picky standards, no matter what we’re reading. It also means that few indie books are picked up and reviewed; there’s stiff competition for our attention, and only so many hours of sleep we can trade-off for a good read.

And the great thing about going to the park is that its free. There is always parks for kids to play at- wherever you are. My kids love going to the park and the one near my old workplace (by the sea) is always a favourite - especailly as the park has had a renovation and has now a pirate ship as part of the play area.

I learned some new terminology, from a PDF from the National Park Service, on the geology and history of this area. Tectonic action not only uplifted the Coast Mountains (which line much of the Inside Passage) but forced up magma into chambers which slowly cooled into granite. These are called Plutons. Uplift and erosion exposed these plutons and now help form the dramatic mountains framing the northern skyline of Skagway.

Luis Pérez-Sala, Team Principal: “We’re very thankful towards Jean Todt for having the courtesy of coming to visit us and we’re delighted to have received him and shown him the new facilities. It was important for him to come and see it personally because on the track all you can see are the cars. You can explain everything that’s behind the scenes but nothing compares to seeing it and experiencing it firsthand to understand the work that is being done. It also gives a chance to explain him the team’s current project and plans to grow in the future. That growth that we’re currently experiencing and will continue to do so is what, with time, will translate into an improvement on the track. I also want to thank the rest of the FIA members, Carlos Gracia and the Spanish Federation, the RACC and the RACE for joining us and I’m very proud that they are also a part of this”.

8. Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction: How ironic that the world’s policeman for weapons of mass destruction is the only one to use them on a mass scale. The United States is on record using chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons. From the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in WWII, to Monsanto’s Agent Orange in Vietnam, to the depleted uranium used in Afghanistan and Iraq, America only condemns itself when speaking about the evils of WMDs. However, killers don’t appear to care how the killing is accomplished, so long as it achieves their goals. The real firecrackers will likely be brought out in a confrontation with Iran, or if China and Russia are lured into the conflict. It won’t really matter much what history says if the use of WMD escalates by either side, but the aggressors should rightly be blamed for the ensuing scorched earth, while the defenders against killers and thieves should be viewed as righteous.

The clinic visits always end on a yucky note, with a throat culture to check for any nasty bacterias the lungs might be housing. At just the time our favorite nurse brought out the giant swab, Ethan had a pretty good coughing spell (left over cough from being sick) and thus got up some good gunk. This was perfect timing, as it would give a pretty good reading as to what was in his lungs. Caleb does not like the giant swab thingy, but after being upset for a second, he opened his mouth up for our favorite nurse and got it over quick.

So if you want to know what's happening with me; for starters you all know I was injured almost 5 yrs ago by a doctor during a "routine Procedure" and am currently suing him, well in Feb. just after getting a fire lit under my lazy lawyer's behind 2 weeks later he dropped me as a client, he finally found a legal way to drop me and i feel he has been looking to do this as soon as "work" came involved. Now it took me a year to find him and thats why I hung on because that year was not fun with all the phone calls and waiting for the rude, belittling denials of lawyer after lawyer. But, I refuse to just quit and its not an easy choice, especially since many are against me, Don't get me wrong I have a few people who are always on my side no matter what and I am thankful for them and being so supportive, but when you are bombarded with negativity and blame for the way your life is because they blame me for it its not easy, when it comes from strangers its a bit easier to ignore but from people who are supposed to be supportive and you thought they were its so much harder and brings the fight that much harder. So, on top of that my health insurance has decided to deny me for my radio frequency nerve block that worked so well and they approved back in Nov. But now in Feb. they say it doesn't work, funny because I had 2 months of such little pain compared to what I am in now and was so much more productive and making strides in improving mobility and usage of my arm. Now I am going backwards and being that my arm is in so much pain 24/7 and spasms, zingers and constant cramping and pin n needles, I am not only physically exhausted but emotionally too. So I have to go thru the appeals process, which so far is not going so well. Then to add to my dilemma, I am still trying to get disability 5 yrs later and layers (HA!) just are in it for $$ so no one wants a person who didn't make tons of $$ and just made low wages. Sorry but just cause I put raising my kids first and not a career doesn't make me any less disabled than someone who has bipolar or ADD only, when I have both and unable to use my right arm on top of it and paid into the system for years. Which would help with my medical debt, even though my insurance covers most of my bills, copays and 20% of everything adds up when you go to Doctors 4 days a week. Then the city has redistrict so now my kids are supposed to go to a different high school next year and they just started at this new one and are finally settling in and have tons of friends and so we had to fill out the form to hope they can stay there and just waiting and I have to drive my kids everyday if they do go and if gas prices don't come down I just don't know what we will do. On top of that my van is falling apart. Then well blogger has lost my posts I had scheduled and would have got me thru at least 3 weeks and maybe not feel so behind. But now I need to rewrite those posts and find my pictures or retake them. I found out recently, that I can write my posts in word and save them there. So hopefully this week I can get a few caught up on and I can get back on track with my Jolee's Series, Friday MTC/SVG Frebiee, Sketch Saturday and MY CTMH Card Kits (which I haven't even started).

Independence Day, for me, has always been linked with my birthday (two days later). Growing up, it was always an almost painful day to get through - so much celebrating but still so long to go before presents and cake. And, on occasion, the cake had a 4th of July theme (you all know the strawberry/blueberry/cool whip cake I'm talking about!). As I watched fireworks in the evening, all I would be thinking was that it was only 36 more hours until MY day. As I get older, I don't have the same kind of anticipation for my birthday, especially as I have started wishing the numbers stayed the same or reversed. (And I know I'm not old, but I'm coming up on some scary birthdays.)

So many lives lost. So many more since then as our country fights this war on terror. So many broken hearts, families who are hurting, families who are forever changed because of these events.

I didn’t find a way to make money but I did think of some practical things I could do to help reduce our living expenses. We trimmed our budget down to bare essentials. I worked out ways to cut costs everywhere. And I worked out how to ration our food. I went through the fridge, freezer and pantry and made a list of everything. I worked out we could eat for about three weeks without shopping except for some fresh items for our daughter. After our food ran out, I had no idea what we would do.
I salute our president, Comrade Oliver Tambo, for leading the ANC even under the most difficult circumstances.
Thank you, Mona.
We should not forget the international brigaders who preceded us, and we must continue to resist oppressive forces, with our shout of no pasaran.
I truly felt it was important to me to hold on to whatever normalcy I had, that being a place to go to for work. I needed the routine. I also strongly felt that I more than knew the business as I’d run it with Rob for 17 years, but this new venture being a retail franchise Firestone had only been in effect since Sept. 1999 for me. I mentioned the tire recall earlier in my posts and that was devastating to our bottom line, but I felt that if I just worked hard enough, got good employees, did great work and ran it honestly and to the best of my abilities, that I could turn things around.

I thought the ending was fantastic! It was unpredictable and different--the characters went down their own paths and there was just something really great about the whole atmosphere. In the past couple of months I've just been reading nothing but contemporary YA (which I adore) and I'm not saying it's been getting boring (because contemp is NEVER boring) but whilst reading Zero I kept thinking to myself how original and just different the book felt. It was just really fab, okay?!
Movember ought to be considered a standard test for modern relationships. The master himself tackles this weighty issue in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit:
I've always created things with my hands. Physical objects that I could hold and say, "Look what I made!" I lived off the high I got from it.
Plus, all the regular features including news, reviews, countdown to the 50th anniversary and the Time Team.
The markets' reaction showed the ANC that a radical change to the country's economic policies and key personnel in ministries like finance would be unwelcome.

I'd really love to see more books with these designs published and using the same names because it's far less confusing if we use the same name for the same design. Imagine if every time someone wrote about Stippling they had to come up with another name? It's too confusing!
I left those chilling thoughts behind and moved on to musing that I'm also turning into MathMan's mother. I actually pulled an insert about the nursing profession out of Sunday's Atlanta Journal Constitution and gave it to Bree to read. Shit. My mother-in-law (may she rest in peace) surrounded herself with stacks of yellowing Chicago Tribunes and Sun-Times that you weren't allowed to move or throw away because she planned to go through them and cut out articles she thought her children would find interesting.
It is hard to look at the above evidence and not think that this race is going to be extremely close. The Democrats have put up their strongest candidate (except Bart Stupak) who is running in a relatively new district against an unpopular incumbent that is struggling to raise money.
I attended another recital at 4:30, this one for a fellow horn player, and I even stuck around afterwards and practiced on my horn for about an hour! I was proud of myself. From the music building, I contacted my friend Lexi. Recall that I first met Lexi on Twitter back in May or so of last year and officially met her last fall when I visited her church, which I now attend. Through me, Aaron started following Lexi on Twitter, and they got to the point where they tweeted each other quite a bit. So I arranged for the two of them to officially meet. Lexi and I went and ate at Chipotle while Aaron ate dinner with his family, and then Lexi and I picked Aaron up. The three of us went to Bahama Buck’s and talked for a while before driving back to the Tech campus and watching a movie in the room (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which neither of them had seen before). It was a nice little get-together, and Andrew even got to meet Lexi for the first time; he had been working at Relay for Life with his fraternity, but he made a quick visit to the room when he learned that Aaron was here. Such a good evening!
These giants of the scientific argument concerning the origins of modern humans almost got it right, and all have unfortunately had their heads raised on the pike of their theories’ obviously not working very well. Wallace, the discover of the process of Natural Selection (Darwin was the popularizer) as usual, stuck his head out the furthest and consequently his head has been raised the highest by the intellectual savages, except for the much earlier Lamarck.

Massive news this week as Activision has announced that they bought Santa Monica Studios, the developers behind Twisted Metal and The God of War series. Santa Monica Studios also teamed up with thatgamecompany to create Flower and Journey, two highly advertised games for the PSN. After regarding Journey as a failure, SMS president claimed “they didn’t get the audience they wanted” for the game. Activision, famous for the record breaking Call of Duty series, was the perfect company to collaborate with for their next title. “We have to make our games more accessible for the current generation of gamers. Activision has proven time and time again what kind of innovative and engaging gaming people ask for.” What this means for the future of God of War is uncertain, but an insider source has leaked a bit of information about the project. “God of War was unsuccessful due to the complexity of the story line. There were too many characters and too few high action moments.” Apparently, customers were unhappy that an action game based on violence did not have any projectiles and explosions. Other complaints included the lack of vehicles to make up for Kratos’s slowness. “The fourth installment of the God of War series will fix all these issues. In this new game, Zeus, who turns out to have survived after God of War 3, sends Kratos to modern times. Stripped of his famous blades, Kratos joins a secret military organization and must use modern weaponry to attack Greece and destroy what remains of Zeus’s temples. The game will be called COD of War: Modern Warfare 4.” With the billions of dollars that Activision rakes in with every Call of Duty, merging the successful franchise with other great series is a step in the right direction. According to the SMS president, the influence of Modern Warfare will not solely resonate with God of War. “We learned from our mistakes with Flower and Journey. Apart from the good graphics, these games clearly lack the value for money of online multiplayer FPS games. We are currently hard at work with a DLC for Journey. The update would allow you to use rifles to attack other players and prevent them from advancing in the game. You can also form teams and battle between temple walls. Fans will love it.” Hopefully, Series like Zelda and Mario can learn a thing or two from Santa Monica Studios and their ambitious projects.

The centers are just pins that I snapped off and then bent into place. I glued them down using quick grip, and then attached the flower with quick grip to my K, but only where the pins were. That way I could still ruffle the 'petals' of my flower to have more of a 3D look.

I enjoyed this one very much. It's a tale to immerse yourself in purely for the pleasure of losing oneself in a good story. Mystery, romance, loss, ghosts, three time periods, the meaning of family. Set in Australia and England, and best of all (for me), ultimately on the Cornish coast. It has it's flaws but it's a very good Summer read methinks.
Maybe, I HOPE, that thanks to the Internet, kids will have a place to go to ask for help. My partner would have LOVED to communicate with another kid who had a disease whom she could relate to. I would have loved to email a kid who shared my darkest thoughts. Together, maybe we wouldn't feel alone with out struggles. Feeling alone is the worst part of being bullied.

Admittedly I was not sure what to expect of Newtimber Hill. Bill’s account had provided clues and the memory of that group of old Witches had dominated my thoughts and dreams for the last 48 hours or so. I tried to remain cautiously excited, all this rain could prevent us from getting anywhere near the top of Newtimber and that would be more than disappointing to say the least.

Today's first batch was a partial mash Dubbed Stone Soup XXI Ale, the Mustachioed Dark IPA (MB0021). I brewed this batch using leftovers from previous batches and a lot of hops. Everything was going well, until I had a stuck sparge. Grain hulls clogged up my mash tun's spigot, causing me to forgo a second batch sparge and add water to bring the boil to volume. Other than that, it was all good.

Another advantage of this over typical labor regulation is what constitutes good working conditions extends across all facets of the job including subtle ones that are difficult to write into law. This encompasses everything from working hours to safety and even intangible aspects such as harassment or prestige. Furthermore, each worker has a different weighting of what constitutes a good job and can individually decide at which point they would quit.

Mom and I spent a good deal of time with our noses pressed to the glass cases holding the gorgeously embroidered and beaded and jeweled copes and robes. Mom's a wonderful seamstress and tried valiantly for years to teach me what came so naturally to her and Grandma. And, alas, failed. However, she did succeed at teaching me embroidery so I'm not completely disowned. Standing in front of Pope Pius IX's red robe, she said over and over, "Look at all those tiny stitches! Just look at them." And then I got to say, "Yes, Mom. I know." Hee hee.
“The big question,” I heard one of the CNN buffoons say as I fished through channels, “is whether the Sanfords will reconcile.” I asked my wife, “Is that really the big question?

I am acutely sensitive to how assumptions are made based on an accent – here in London, I often help a Filipino friend by making phone calls on her behalf because she finds that people – like her doctor and council workers – change their behavior when confronted with someone who has an accent that is not as “other” as hers.
Still simple, of course, just make these two changes to the mix instructions, and frost!

Most of the people who develop Trichopahagia and do not manage to break the habit quickly will end up with digestive pains, severe indigestion and in the worst cases – gastrointestinal blockages. I have come across a few stories of people who have been admitted to hospital after their body has refused to accept any food or water where they are given immediate surgery to remove a ball of hair occupying the entire space of their stomach (click here to see a picture if you are not light hearted). As Trichophagia is a result of depression and anxiety in most instances it is normally treated with anti depression medication and therapy for those people who seek help.
Since being reminded of this “rule,” I’ve started reading with an eye toward evaluating how much use these pariahs get in the books that I enjoy. They’re not absent. In fact, they appear frequently in some of the books I like very much. Maybe my tastes are very un-literary. This has led me to believe that we, as writers, should be very careful with these types of “rules,” especially when critiquing the work of others. It is easy to stand with a crowd of self-professed literary types and spout dogma as if it was your own original thought. It is harder, perhaps, to step away from the crowd and see where a writer might be justified in breaking a rule to the benefit of their work.
The Primer has a good saving, only £6.75 opposed to the £8.99 and after all it's primer so who needs to be picky right? Well sort of. First up the coverage is grainy. The finished surface is slightly bumpy in looks. It paints fine but I feel not as smoothly as Vallejo. Nothing so bad that I would not use it and in truth if I had bought this first I would not have tried the more expensive Vallejo. It's hard to quantify but I feel that the Vallejo sprayed more figures, but that's a hunch.
we've had this gun cabinet of my grandad's for quite a while. when we moved him out of his house and into a nursing home about five years ago my mom, aunt, sisters and i were able to keep some of the things from his house that we liked. at the time we thought we would use it to store griffin's guns. we havent been able to find a place for it in any of the three homes that we lived in and we realized it was more logical to put his guns in a safe than out on display anyway.

Why we should be on dead end street.
The metaphorical interpretation is an interesting approach to the problem of Ephesians 5. I am not sure that I could hold an audience long enough to explain such a position with those who expect a quick, two-punch sound bite or proof text. Nevertheless, the interpretation is a useful reminder that texts should not always be taken at face value or as prescriptive when they are just as likely meant to function as literary or as descriptive.

. . . Thursday Sara and I got going a bit sluggishly, but finally made it out the door and headed to Fisherman’s Wharf to meet Holly. Unfortunately, we got a bit lost. We needed to get off in downtown and change from the subway to a trolley, but thought we changed at the end of the line. So we backtracked back to downtown to wait for the trolley. It was almost 1 pm already and poor Holly had been waiting a while. So we went against my penny-pinching nature and took a cab to Fisherman’s Wharf.
TLC instead strongly supports bicycle lanes on each side of Longwood, which would create a continuous connected cycling route from Aberdeen to King Street (and eventually all the way to Princess Point) – it is our position that the road diet planned in the Shifting Gears Cycling plan should be implemented to help calm traffic and create the space required for cycling lanes.
On April 15, 1912, Lydia Beaumont is on her way to a new life with a boundless hope in love and faith. Her new friendship with Caroline Chadwick is bonded even more as they plan Lydia’s wedding on board the “grandest ship ever built.” Then both women suffer tragic losses when the “unsinkable” Titanic goes down. Can each survive the scars the disaster left on their lives?
The strength of this technique is fairly plain: if you tell the reader exactly what the car/object is, then they have a ready image of it. It is as specific as you can really be, without having to describe what the object is.

She confides in Kathryn, who tells her that if she cares about Emmett, she has to say something, no matter the cost. Bay goes to talk to Cameron, who promises that Olivia is done selling drugs. He offers to ask her to move out, declaring that he is determined not to let Melody win. Bay hones in on his word choice, admonishing him that this is about Emmett, and while she may lose him over this, it’s certainly not about Cameron “winning.”
“Where are you now? Can you come over later please?” I asked.
Sorry but the pictures are a bit dark but Hubby AKA Mr Technical took them and decided he needed to stand over them blocking the light in order to get a clear shot!!! Oh well, best not asking why!!

“Wisdom” – A Palindrome
I flash back to my days as a P.A. (Production Assistant) in live television concerts. I once was sent to Bed, Bath and Beyond on a frantic fetch for white candles for Jennifer Lopez's trailer because apparently everything in the trailer had to be white and the green candles in there would just not do. Jenny From The Block. Keeping it real. How, exactly, do people end up in that special crazytimes place where reality takes a nosedive? I also watched one of the tour managers for Def Leppard light into a woman in the talent department (who was 8 months pregnant at the time) over the cheese plate on their provided private jet. Standing there watching a grown man yell his head off at a tiny, 5 foot tall pregnant woman over a cheese plate made me think that yes, in fact, the human race will eventually be wiped off the planet.
Sunday was the Super Bowl. It was so deliciously American, all those beefy guys running around showing off their tight butts and tackling each other all sexy-like. We watched the game with a handful of friends at a bar in West Seattle.
If you did the kind of thing to someone in the street, deliberately, the way Balotelli did that, deliberately, on the field of play, you’d be arrested and charged with assault. We’re not taking “mistimed tackle” here, and we’re not talking “he went in a little hard” – he clearly and deliberately (watch it on youtube if you don’t believe me) looked, lifted his foot, and tried to break Alex’s leg (or at least injure him).

So, the reason for all this rant has a dual purpose. Obviously, I am a proud member, DIYC is a fantastic sailing organization. DIYC may as well stand for do it yourself club. The other reason is that there are hundreds of clubs, sailing centers, sailing squadrons, etc . that provide similar enjoyment to their members and fellow sailors in those areas. I can mention several in my area that are similar in intent and efforts (DIYC still is the sailingest club in the south though). Plenty, that if I happened to live in their area, I would be a proud contributing member as well.

And please don't think that I feel the bad judgement shown by these parents has anything to do with their age. I think that even though most teenagers/young adults are not ready to be parents, there are always exceptions. That's one reason why I wanted to write the Willow Ryan series, with the main character being a teenage mother having and raising a baby on her own. There are some teenagers out there who are mature, responsible, and selfless enough to successfully raise children, and I find them incredibly inspiring. But these people at the playground, they are just idiots. It doesn't matter if you're 15, 30, or 45, dressing your child in a shirt that proclaims to the world that they will grow up to be a man who sells women for sex is a crime. Or at least it should be. And I am appalled that this shirt even exists.
Like any family, we have regular little dos and don’ts that aren’t written down anywhere but are pretty well understood as law in our house. You heard these standards before, I’m sure: no running, don’t hit people, quiet voices indoors, don’t take your sister’s toys, clear your place when you’re finished, etc…. Such are important simply to ease the motions of living together in a household. And most of them are dictatorial and begin with negatives. Necessary, probably--but pleasant or life-affirming, definitely not.

Her lips barely fit around his cock, but even still, she had half of him stuffed in her mouth. Dim light came through the half-open window and made both of them glisten a little – her with a little trail of sweat on her belly and him from the saliva on his rod. I couldn’t help it. For the space of thirty, maybe forty-five seconds, I just stared, completely enraptured by the show in front of me. Both of them were completely oblivious to anything going on around them. That made it hotter, I think. The two of them were so devoted to pleasuring one another that they had no idea that someone was watching.
Last Monday (11th) I chaired a quiet, intimate event with the lovely Helen Oyeyemi, who was reading from and talking about her latest, Mr Fox. First she read out the dark fairy tale of the same name, about a young woman who outwits a dastardly murderer: 'Be bold, be bold, but not too bold...' Mr Fox the woman-killer crops up in all cultures, she pointed out, sometimes in unsuspected guises - I hadn't spotted that Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca is a variant of the story. I could have happily discussed fairy tales with Oyeyemi all night.

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add a couple tablespoons of oil and cover the bottom with a layer of the seasoned meat. Brown on both sides turning once. The desire is to put a caramelized coating on the meat over high heat but be careful not to burn the sucs or browned coating of fond in the bottom of the pan. Remove cooked meat to a paper lined plate to drain and continue cooking remaining sliced meat adding more oil as needed. In the same skillet, cook the ground beef stirring along the bottom to loosen the flavorful brown sucs. Drain the grease off and set meat aside.

We have given up being part of a steadfast community. Yes, I know that cruiser's have their own community, and I love participating in it. But let's face it. We are all water gypsies. We come and go, move here and there. You often don't even know when the last time you will see someone is. One minute they're in the next anchorage over, and the next minute they're off to Timbuktu. Or vice versa. It's a very transient life and if you are truly cruising around yourself, you never have coffee with the same friend two weeks in a row. That's cruising. I miss having friends that you see every week and know what's going on, and have over for dinner every Thursday, month after month.

The lunch has been excellent though. Right down the street from my office is a salad bar place called "Suppe y Salate" where one can find pumpkin and pear chunks, fresh walnuts, and diced rainbow paprika among other toppings for a salad. When I'm not in the mood for that, I go for a falafel wrap at this AMAZING place Gyros Sofra around the corner where they make their own fluffy bread right in front of you, then fill it with homemade falafel, red pepper paste, hummus and tahini sauce. It's so good that I actually went there 4 times in one week but I decided to give them a break in case they think I'm weird. (Although let's be real: I'm going today.)

Abella has nonetheless made a valiant, often revealing and original effort to uncover RAND’s internal struggles — not least of which involved the decision of analyst Daniel Ellsberg, in 1971, to leak the Department of Defense’s top secret history of the Vietnam War, known as The Pentagon Papers to Congress and the press. But Abella’s book is profoundly schizophrenic. On the one hand, the author is breathlessly captivated by RAND’s fast-talking economists, mathematicians, and thinkers-about-the-unthinkable; on the other hand, he agrees with Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis’s assessment in his book, The Cold War: A New History, that, in promoting the interests of the Air Force, RAND concocted an “unnecessary Cold War” that gave the dying Soviet empire an extra 30 years of life.

2010 was something of a high water mark for me: it was as if a number of energies simultaneously caught fire and delivered a concentrated year of brilliant, memorable theatre. Perhaps inevitably, 2011 has had a feeling of being on the shoulder of a peak, perhaps reinforced by a sense that main stage theatre here is in significant transition. Certainly it's been hard to look towards Sydney and not feel that Sydney main stage theatre has it all over us.

It doesn’t really matter to me what people choose to believe. I just hope they have some hope. I find our thoughts are often our greatest source of pain. Sometimes religious thoughts cause suffering. Even religious people can have an idea “I hope God forgives me.”

Now I have to be careful here, as I many friends who love Sams and would probably never have a bad word to say about it. Sams has everything going for it, the location in old lifeboat house gives it both character and a glorious view. However, it’s popularity has a downside. We booked for Sunday lunch but the earliest table was 3 in the afternoon. On balance we decided we were happy with this. A late brunch, a walk and arriving at three on a winter’s afternoon would suit us perfectly. However, they should have warned us that the menu offering was likely to be depleted by then.

Considered to be an excellent beginner beer by some and the reason why many are interested in craft beer. The deep orange color and thick white head has aromas of hops and fruits (more citrus). There is a noticeable hop flavor that is nicely complemented by prominent malt flavors. An excellent “hop primer” beer and a great way to show how versatile the hop is.
On Dec 23rd, I heard there was a very active thread about him on an adoption forum which I don't read. So, I jumped over there and caught up with his story. While reading the thread, I discovered there was a family who was trying to bring him home, but their agency was not cooperating.

On Saturday at 15.30, from the Cathedral towards the Friedhof am Perlacher Forst, the clergy led a large procession to the graves of Alexander’s friends, the brother and sister Hans and Sophie Scholl, and Christoph Probst, executed in February 1943. They honoured the memory of prayer and a moment of silence. Then, the participants in this out-of-the-ordinary and rare phenomenon, the making of a saint from a mere mortal man, trudged through the snow-covered cemetery to the grave of Alexander Schmorell. Despite the bitter cold, the priests served a litiya, and, then, the marchers returned to the cathedral for the last Pannikhida for Alexander before his glorification. After the Vigil service, the clergy brought out the icon of the new saint and they sang the service to the new saint before it.

Reboot again. Open Quicken, open scheduled transactions, Quicken crashes. In all, we must have gone through the same scenario a dozen times but now we are including his magical checks of the system and processes and such but nothing is working. We are now also including looking up for old backups and there are about a million and a half backups on my computer and I haven’t a clue what any of them are or if they are any good now or not. In a massive fit of pique, I delete all backups that don’t have a year end date of them and start labeling with something that makes sense to me, not Quicken! I do manage to open a fairly recent backup and print out my scheduled transaction list so that I have it in case I need to re-enter it.
Why? Underground Love is definitely a beautiful and gentle opening for an EP that was recorded mostly in a apartment bedroom. The soothing music delivered by melodic guitars and marching drums in some parts of the song will make you feel like floating into a peaceful and dreamy place in the air. The vocal which fits perfectly with the relaxing music undoubtedly adds an atmospheric feeling and makes it a very fine track. The best friends duo clearly lead us the way to a next state of contentment with their mature craft. So, take a listen and find out what Underground Love feels like.

Two of Sarawak’s most influential outlets have been Radio Free Sarawak and Sarawak Report, founded by Peter John Jaban, a former employee from the Sarawak Land and Surveys Department, and British investigative journalist Claire Rewcastle Brown. Based in London, far away from Malaysia’s stifling sedition and media laws, these outfits began investigating Taib’s empire and broadcasting its reports into Sarawak, exposing not only the magnitude of Taib’s vested interests but also where his illicit funds were ending up: not in Sarawak’s developing economy, but in a convoluted offshore portfolio estimated to top $1 billion stretching from London to Monaco, Ottowa to Sydney12. The tension deepened even further when a prominent whistleblower, a former Taib aide named Ross Boyert was found dead in an L.A. motel room with bag taped over his head in a rare form of suspected suicide13. Members of the opposition have rightly pointed out that, since Malaysia has one the world’s highest rates of illicit capital outflows, totalling $291 billion between 2000-2008, Taib is an blinding obvious place to begin the clean-up of Malaysia’s politics and economy14.
*B has been very sick this week. We have spent a lot of time on the couch together watching fascinating TV such as Say Yes to the Dress and What Not to Wear. I am completely ready for her wedding and I will dress the part.
The club is having dinner, not right here, but close enough that I would normally go, but I don't think that I will go. There's the whole watching what I eat thing, and I can't sit in front of bowls of chips and salsa and not eat them. It will only be six weeks or so before my husband is back to asking me out for ice cream (if he even makes it that long), and I'm really trying to do nothing of that sort until then. So I won't be going out Sunday, and I even have to decide what to do about the next Saturday. Of course, I will go out then, but then I have to wonder if I'll eat anything or get a soda or what. To go out and buy nothing is rude, to go out and buy things I shouldn't eat is bad, and going out and then special ordering something like broccoli seems a waste.

Many Danes had to pinch themselves a month ago when their new prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who heads a coalition of leftist parties, launched a strategy document called Denmark 2032. This addressed frankly the need for Denmark to define some tough spending priorities. Its underlying presumption was that the universal welfare state with its generous entitlements would not be able to survive in its current form.

Through the work of a poet called Clemens Brentano, many of these fascinating insights were published during the middle of the nineteenth century. Several books of visions were published, though two were particularly popular: The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich and The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary From the Visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich.
I visited my local quilting store and found the perfect fabric for the "I Spy Charm Swap" that I am participating in. I was surprised to learn that the store actually had a few fabrics from Sarah Jane's Children at Play collection! This is one of my favorite fabric lines; I was this close to buying the entire collection at one point online. I must say touching those fabrics in person at the store was so surprisingly satisifying!
On a positive note, I did hear the baby's heartbeat on Tuesday... it took me forever to find it with my doppler but it was a beautiful sound and gave me just a little inkling of hope. We have started telling family members about it before we break the news to the entire community of people we know and have already gotten the typical "I know everything will be all right" and it's annoying the heck out of me. You don't have any way to guarantee my baby will arrive safe and sound in my arms in 6 months - no way at all... it doesn't matter how many times you say that to me - until that baby is in my arms and healthy and crying, I can't believe that everything will be just fine... I just can't.

That being said, the advancement of the gay agenda continues to be predicated on the notion that homosexuals are an oppressed group in our society. This continues despite the fact that as a group they have higher levels of education than their heterosexual counterparts, they generally have higher incomes than heterosexuals and have no restrictions in terms of where they live or what they do for a living. As a group gays have a very sympathetic ear in the media as well as educational and governmental institutions. These are measures of equality, but the current concern isn’t so much about equality and freedom as it is about sanctioning and normalizing homosexual relationships. On this front the gay agenda has met much more resistance and as a result gay rights advocates have lashed out against the group they see as being the primary barrier to full acceptance – believing Christians.

I’m not sure why I have such an obsession with Afternoon Tea. Maybe it’s the relaxing visiting time, the tiny desserts, the soothing cup of tea, or having an excuse to get dressed up during the middle of the day! Whatever it is, the Omni did not disappoint. My mom and I had 3:00 reservations, and we were the only ones there besides two tables full of old ladies playing cards. How cute! Fadi, the manager, and another young man took very good care of us. I started off with the Flora tea, and it was fruity with a kick of cinnamon. Perfect for 80 degree weather.
Ten minutes after the worms have got going, the ostracods start swimming upwards, slowly at first, we just see the odd line of vertical lights coming up among the corals and seaweeds, moving gently in the current. Each male ostracod gives off four dots to signal their presence to any females who might be around, then the lights become more and more until the water is pulsating with wavy lines of vertical blue dots all moving upwards.

Tokyo Magniute 8.0 is just an 11-episode anime about 2 siblings and a single mother trying to survive through a disastrous magnitude 8.0 earthquake centered on Tokyo. This is actually based on a theory that there is a 70% chance that an at least 7.0 quake could hit Tokyo in the next two years. Do take note that this anime was written before the great Tohoku Quake earlier this year.
That eldest sister is a whirlwind, I tell ya. She travels quite a bit for her (own) business and for the first time, it brought her into my town. Well, near enough for a visit. She arrived in town last night, around 11pm. We stayed up and shared some wine, and a good deal of conversation, and she saw my scrapbooking for the first time (other than gifts I have sent). We didn't go to bed until 2am, despite both of our needing to be up by seven the next morning.

At the corner of M and North Capitol, we caught up to him. The officer driving the car chirped the siren, and pulled to the curb when the boy started biking faster.

Second, Instead of praising education we marginalize it as African Americans. Third, we accept mediocrity as the standard in the Black community.” I will capture and quote parts of the article because I think the writer was on point.

Since roughly mid-October, I've been having a really fun time with persistent dizziness and vertigo. It started out pretty strong--no matter which direction or how quickly (or slowly) I moved my head, I got SERIOUSLY dizzy and off-balance. It was scary and it made me super nauseated to the point that I felt like I was always on the verge of throwing up, but never quite able to seal the deal--a lovely, lovely feeling. I got some motion sickness medicine at the drug store, and although it helped with the nausea, it made me insanely sleepy. So yeah, not much help. After a couple of weeks of dealing with this bullshit and it only getting moderately better (i.e., looking side-to-side didn't bug me as much, and I wasn't about to puke all the time, but the rest of it was still present), I went to see my family doctor. She gave me a shot of steroids in my ass (to help with the nausea) and some well-known prescription meds for this type of thing that, guess what, make you sleepy as Hell and lists "dizziness" as one of its side effects. She also told me, "If this hasn't gotten better in a month, come back and see me."

Once you cross the Greenway, the trail takes on a very different character, full of up-and-down terrain with high bluffs overlooking the lake and a couple of deep ravines. Because of the ravines, the trail takes a circuitous route that alternately goes to the lake and then away from it. This section is the best for anyone wanting to get some exercise, either by trail running or strenuous hiking. Still, even if you’re intent on exercise, you won’t want to miss the lake view at about the 1.5-mile mark. A short trail to the left leads to a point that has a makeshift bench. From there, you can get a view of the lake and the Atlantic & Yadkin Greenway Bridge in the distance.

There is an illusion involved in arguments like these, as though we can assume for the sake of argument that we do have access to the true nature of things, then argue from there that we don't have access to the true nature of things. If the conclusion is true, then it was true at the beginning of the argument as well as the end. The argument apparently starts with some premises concerning the variety of the nature of things, e.g. the variety between our sensory apparatus and a bat's. What it really started with was the variety in our conscious constructions on sense impressions which, according to Kant, say nothing about any actual variety in reality. So what if the conscious construction we put on sense impressions and call a "bat" has a different character than the conscious construction we put on sense impressions of ourselves and call "men"? Whatever conclusions we might draw from this fact says nothing about the actual sensory capabilities of either men or bats, or the relationship between the two. It is at best about the quirky nature of our own consciousness.

When the first words out of her mouth referred to the movie Hunger Games, my first thought was “Huh?” Then she explained. The main character in the movie, Katniss, has both masculine and feminine character traits. She embodies the very non-traditional image of a woman as someone who is both physically and mentally equal to the level of a man. In other words, she is a perfect portrayal of a modern female warrior. For the rest of the presentation, we go back into Ancient Rome.
I have been involved in the politics of Lambeth and its local authority for a quarter of a century. I was living in the borough when the Ted Knight administration took on the Thatcher Government. I supported them then and think today they were right to fight against that appalling reactionary shower. Had Labour local authorities stuck together in 1985 in the struggle against ratecapping there might never have been a third term Tory Government (we shall never know).
The group walked along Pacific Street, passed the now blocked and soon to be destroyed Carlton Avenue bridge up to Vanderbilt Avenue. Then the group turned and headed back on Dean Street. It's remarkable to walk these long blocks, a space larger in acres than the World Trade Center site, and imagine the overbuilding proposed for this area. I have a lot more thoughts about the experience, the fellowship of the community and the activities of the photographers which was benign and jovial despite the weather-insanity. But I'm still too numb from the cold to process. So thoughts, soon come, for now here's some choice photos I took of the moment.

Case in point: one Saturday night I was having a rather smooth and painless evening behind the bar. The bar was fairly busy, people were tipping and we hadn't ran out of glassware (yet). As soon as the DJ announced Last Call, the night instantly turned from peace into total chaos in a matter of seconds. It seems that whenever the DJ calls Last Lall, people rush the bar to get in their last minute drink orders. I love inflated crowd. The more people ordering drinks means the more tips the bar will make.

I've wondered, when I gaze into the looking glass... if I wear a masque for myself too often. I wonder how much truth comes from behind these masques... if they are half truths, partially disguised for the viewer, partially revealed, because honestly, we really want people to know who we truly are, to some extent... or at least, we show them who we want them to believe we are.

I went vegan for ethical reasons. (And to impress my hot vegan boyfriend at the time. So shoot me.) I thought about it deeply and felt that, if I were on a desert island alone with my dog, I would probably have to eat her. But not being on a desert island, I was privileged to not have to eat my dog, or any other animal. I always could, but I don't have to. So why should I contribute to a system that harms the planet, causes unspeakable cruelty to living beings, and facilitates human rights abuses on labor?
She is clever, and has a fairly public job, so I can see why some men might not like it if she’s having to do lots of public engagements.

Here is my card for this month's challenge. I hope Daddy O likes it! Be sure and check out all the Dueling Darlings creations. Their blog links are on the right side bar.
UPDATE: The base was booby-trapped with two nukes. Thousands in Baja Calif and Sonora have felt the explosions. Several Plejaran ships were destroyed when the nukes went off. Semjase’s fleet is moving in to clean up radiation damage.
Even if some of them have taken the long way ‘round via The Lord Nelson, the Opera House, raucous taxi rides and giggling treks down unfamiliar paths with a paper bag full of beer, glasses and discount vouchers.
And of course as soon as it snows all the electricity goes off for miles around.
Today as the weather was pants windy and very grey we all decided to go to Ashby-de-la Zouch. After much deliberation and checking on the internet we arrived outside the Globe pub to wait. Betty said the bus was due at 10.25 I thought is was due at 10.16, sure enough a bus going in the opposite direction arrived at 10.16 and then promptly arrived back at 10.25 so your guess is as good as mine who was right. Once again everyone said hello and the driver asked us if we were on a boat on in a caravan.( There is a caravan club site at the back of the pub). It only took about 20 minutes to get to Ashby and it is a pleasant little town not too much going on but we had lunch out and then caught the 1 o'clock bus back having the same driver who brought us. As there doesn't seem to be any designated bus stops in Snarestone you just ding the bell when when you want to get off. Just as we got back to the boat it started to rain yet again hopefully tomorrow will be a bit better and we will return from whence we came. Moored near us are Bob and Rachael nb Nomad Dream needless to say while I was out the men talked engines.
I can't remember when I last saw a shrew, and to be honest, I'm not absolutely certain I'd seen one in the wild before. I was fairly convinced I had - I recognised it instantly, and shrews are relatively widespread mammals aren't they? But if you asked me to pinpoint when or where I'd be a bit stumped. It occurred to me that before last week, it's just possible I'd only seen pictures of them in books.
“We might as well try it,” says Mr Young. “I mean, what can go wrong? It just has to get hot and steamy, after all. Is there really any need to pay more just for fancy switches and lights and a big water chamber?”
I'll leave you with yet another graphic that I've made. This one is cool to me because of the asymmetric aspect of the elements. I hope you enjoy it and have a wonderful week!
So I am doing this challenge and the first one is to do animal print nails. I will post the list of the dates and themes at the end of this post. Since I don't really dig animal prints, I decided to do some animals. Birds. But not just any birds. Angry ones. I only did my left hand and I think I will try this mani again sometime in the future and do the pigs on my right hand. We all know how easy it is to do nail art on your dominant hand right?
Meanwhile high up in the stands “studio” one, some, or all of, Graeme Souness, Uncle Jeff Stelling, Glenda Hoddle and Jamie Redknapp described the goings on as of the greatest Champions League games ever as if our exploits at the Ataturk Stadium in 2005 were a routine, ho hum walk in the park! Nonetheless I wish Chelsea luck in Munich and hope that, as result of making it through, they are distracted and that this manifests itself on 5th May at Wembley!

Should you want to read Leviticus 15:5-27 you would find no less than thirteen occasions of washings or baptisms, in various form. Should the person fail to comply, he would be living in sin and disobedience.
Surely there must have been a better way to go about it. I didn't qualify for any scholarships, work studies or grants -- but maybe I didn't try hard enough to find ones I *did* qualify for. My monthly student loan payments are on par with a 160K mortgage and I won't even own a home at the end of them. I do wonder whether I would have finished my degree when I did, if at all if I had had to go half-time and worked harder to earn money to pay for college. I only finished my degree because I was able to live with family rent-free after transferring to another school. If I had just done that in the first place would I be in the financial hard spot I'm in now? Probably not. No one really cares where you get your bachelors degree anyhow, only that you have one.

Such is the case with some too tight, too short sweaters I had, that I converted to cardigans.
‘The detractors found little support at that time, but for whatever reasons, there are more people who have come up to support them now,’ said Prof Levin.
I have been working a lot on my health...in practically every aspect. The stress of loss, life, and just my own faults have really taken a toll.
If you haven’t heard about infant potty training, you probably think I’m a nut. The mother of my children, who entrusted me with their care so she could feed and house them, thought I was a nut, too. Soon after we moved from East Dulwich to neighboring Nunhead she asked me to stop torturing her children and vacate the premises.
However, O’Donnell said previous interviews, mostly with network TV morning show hosts, have been too soft on Mr Sonner — who has mostly refused to give specific details about the case.

I did machine quilt it but just the around the blocks. I didn't quilt any of the detail. It most likely has a polyester batting since that is all I used to use. It's still one of my most often used battings since I hand quilt.

Friday evening involved a lovely dinner with my boyfriend's whole family and then The Hunger Games. It was a nice night. We stayed up until 2:30am... something I stopped doing regularly about 3 years ago (getting old is depressing).
Last night, the county dipped down to 20, possibly even lower in a few areas. According to the paper at least half of the local cherry crop is lost. Of course, these are the caveats of farming, the weather can devastate a year's worth of hard work.

You can level up your character in various abilities (stealth/guns/hacking/martial arts etc) to help you along the way which means most people are likely to get a different experience during their time with the game.
For me, it's simple. What is an agent's track record of sales? If solid, then it's probably just going to be a matter of whether you also connect with the agent as a person. By the way, whether an agent with a good track record is a good fit for you as an author is actually a whole different question than whether an agent is a good agent. One agent might be fantastic for one kind of client and disaster for another client who has different needs.
If you don't believe me, listen to this: we've had Kraft Mac N' Cheese, Maggi 2 Minute Noodles and Old El Paso Tacos on rotation.
The problem with hiding your sins is that they always come back. Just when you think some have atoned for past transgressions, a once-pure Prince can't help but commit a new one.
Amazingly, when I finished the first draft of what would eventually be titled Dreaming Anastasia, Baba Yaga was not a character. In that first version – which actually garnered me an agent! – Anastasia was in some sort of blue light mystical holding zone that Anne and Ethan accessed by discovering a secret portal in Chicago’s Art Institute. Yes, I know – portals? Waaaay over done. But I was a newbie. I’d loved that portal in season 2 of Angel went the gang went to Pylea and saved Fred and Cordy got to briefly become royalty…Excuses, excuses.
I love the effortless chic that a kimono-inspired print gives to an outfit. My roommate from this past summer (when I subletted in the West Village) owned an authentic kimono robe, and it was so luscious. Too bad you can't wear a house robe outside. (Or can you?)

Bottom Line: $22 is not exactly cheap for a bottle of nail polish. However, Dior has a nice range of unique shades to choose from and the formula is quite stellar. If you are on a budget, definitely check out Exquix. For those looking to splurge, this holiday collection is a great place to start.
Football and College Bowl season makes its way to Cowboys Stadium in early fall attracting diehard pigskin fanatics for all over to Arlington, where we take football seriously. Not forgetting that for the past two years, the two-time ALCS champs Texas Rangers have brought out-of-town baseball fans to Rangers Ballpark for not one, but two World Series legs!

With Mothers’ Day just around the corner, it was refreshing to see this article written by a man, as it struck a chord with me as I’m sure with most women. Often times I feel so unappreciated, as a woman’s work in the house never ends, especially if there are kids in the picture. So I decided to share Zig’s article with you.
13: "Every general norm demands a normal, everyday frame of life to which it can be factually applied and which is subjected to its regulations. The norm requires a homogeneous medium. This effective normal situation is not a mere 'superficial presupposition' that a jurist can ignore; that situation belongs precisely to its immanent validity. There exists no norm that is applicable to chaos. For a legal order to make sense, a normal situation must exist, and he is sovereign who definitely decides whether this normal situation actually exists."
I believe if we ask God he will see the desires of our hearts. He wants us to be happy and live a life full of peace, love, and Joy. It's just that he can see the whole picture and we can't. That means he always knows what best for us even if its not our dream!
Some might think that BeerJanglin' is anti-Budweiser. And some might not be completely wrong. But we are getting very tired of the trend of this Belgian-owned company spreading blatant falsehoods, especially while claiming themselves to be the "Great American Lager." Drinkability. Clarity. Patriotism. All reasons that you should shun the craft brewing industry and drink Bud.
I just discovered the Clorox Clean-Up Recipes for Fun Site. Whether you are looking for Wacky Science, Arts and Crafts, Kiddie Cooking, or Creative Cooking ideas this site has what you are looking for. They have several examples of activities in each category. I just browsed through and there are a ton of great ideas for us to try. I know that we will enjoy them all. I love when I find a new site full of fun activities for us to do that we can also learn from and work together as a family on.

I hate working out, and, as I just said, I am not nor do I have a desire to be an athlete. But I cannot fully describe the joy that Taekwondo brought to my life. I have noted before, at least to Anthony, that I notice a significant difference in my happiness when I have TKD in my life, versus when I don’t. Yesterday I was feeling utterly shitty, walked home, grabbed workout clothes, walked all the way back to work and practiced my forms, and I felt better.

If you've never used Skype at school, what do you think? Is my bad attitude justified, or should I look at this as the perfect opportunity to try something new?
When Applicants are dissatisfied by a USPTO action, there are 2 avenues for potential relief: (1) appeal to the Federal Circuit, and (2) file a §145 civil action in district court. While an appeal limits review of an application to the evidence of record, §145 actions afford an applicant the opportunity to introduce new evidence after the close of administrative proceedings.

Yep. Nothing sexy. Moderate bitterness with less malt than an ale, it's light and drinkable but that's about it. Better than a macro, nothing close to their other beers. Gets a bit card-boardy as it warms.
The experience was entirely different, amusing and therapeutic. I didn’t really have to travel a thousand miles to find a place conferring immunity to life’s injustices.
While I’m having a lovely time seeing friends and family again, there’s absolutely no doubt that Paul is the one who’s enjoying this holiday more than anybody, mostly because he’s being treated as an equal by everybody and given the chance to prove himself capable. In fact, I think this is probably his best holiday for a very, very long time. I have to admit that I was a bit apprehensive about bringing him with me because, what with my disability and his, we're a bit like the blind leading the blind at times, but he hadn't been back since we left to move back to the UK twelve years ago so it was only fair he came too. I'm glad he did. Sometimes you just have to throw yourself into a situation and hope for the best.

Sailors’ Bethel built at a cost of £2,000 to the design of Thos. Oliver Junior was opened on the 12th of April 1877. The word “Beth-el” is Hebrew for “House of God”, and in the 130 years of its existence this building has served as a nonconformist chapel, a community centre, a Danish seamen’s church and now, finally, offices.

A couple of Fridays ago was Dr Seusss' birthday. I'm sure it was no coincidence that our local library was hosting a Dr Seuss story session. I've been to these sessions before and while they're fun, they involve loads of parents and kids squished in to a room and I'm really not sure it was something that O would like. Also, it was a glorious day.
Since none of these skills were reliant on skill points or the like, they always worked at their full capacity. Really, there's very little number-crunching necessary in Diablo III. Even the four primary stats are simply representatives of how much damage, critical chance, health and the like your character has. While some have decried this as a lack of customization, it really serves to get you back into the action faster--there's no need to stop the zombie-smashing! And, really--by the time I finished the beta, I was level 10 and had about 12 skills to choose from, which made for plenty of choices already. And with the rune system still on deck? Yeah, choice won't be a commodity here.
It is time consuming, and efforts can be fruitless, but with patience, a few good thunderstorms and these tips you should be able to capture some lightning on camera.
Her name is Julia, and she has the lead role in an Obama 2012 slide show that follows what’s supposed to be an American everywoman from childhood into retirement, tracking everything the Obama White House’s policies would do for her and everything the “Romney/Ryan” Republicans would not. The list of Obama-bestowed benefits includes Head Start when Julia’s a tyke, tax credits and Pell grants to carry her through college and low-interest loan repayment afterward, guaranteed birth control when she’s a 20-something and government-sponsored loans when she wants to start a business, all of it culminating in a stress-free retirement underwritten by Medicare and Social Security.
I love seeing my friends succeed. Especially my younger friends. I love seeing them encounter a challenge and be able to overcome it.
The wide-eyed boy-child we saved, 20 years or so ago, is now a priapic, Kalashnikov-bearing hearty, siring children whenever the whim takes him.
I wonder about pep talks like this one, however. I have given myself innumerable pep talks throughout my life and none of them have done any good. I think the best thing is to focus outside of yourself. Focus on the customer or the coworker or boss and make their interaction with you as pleasant, empowering and focused as you can. That is the secret of social success and customer service success. Do not focus on yourself, it is deadly. Focus on the other person, and allow yourself to disappear in the act of service. It is hard to describe but I have done it. So I know it can be done, even if it can’t be described very well. So wish me luck because I start my new job in earnest next week. That is when I will need to start demonstrating that I can be an asset to the team. I have been going through some changes and my old neuroses feel comfortable in the face of the unknown future. But I intend to embrace that future wholeheartedly with the same courage and determination I brought to my surgery. Maybe I could consider this social surgery, a removal of social cataracts which hold me back and prevent me from seeing situations clearly. Oddly, I am both an introvert and extrovert, which confuses people sometimes. I can be very friendly and outgoing with them and then the next time I might be withdrawn and seemingly aloof. I am at odds with myself. But I am confident I will get it together, because I am determined to impress my coworkers and my boss with my teamwork. I really want this job to become permanent in October, and I am very clear on how that can happen.

You do not need to precook the chicken. It will cook as it boils in the canner. I put 1 tsp of chicken bouillon in the bottom of each jar. This is not necessary but I was interested in having really good broth for chicken soup. I cut all the fat off my boneless, skinless thighs, and then put them into the jars. There is no need to add any liquid. You should not pack them down tightly but they cook down quite a bit during the canning process. Next time I will put more in than I did this time. Make sure that you leave an inch of head room though.
Recently, I had an interesting exchange with an editor that wanted to use my recipe for Meringue Pillows with Strawberries and Cream from Basic to Brilliant, Y’all in a non-food publication. We exchanged a few emails and I sent the recipe along — then she emailed me back, saying that it looked too hard.

There was a time when I could quote this entire book by heart. I’ll still give it the old college try when challenged, but no promises that I’ll make it through the opening lines: “I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there’s gum in my hair and when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on the skateboard and by mistake I dropped my sweater in the sink while the water was running and I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.” We’ve all been in poor Alexander’s shoes. Some days, absolutely nothing goes right. Some days, the only viable option seems to be to escape to Australia. This book is fast-paced, spirited, with a universally recognizable theme for both adults and children.

Most Baptists are varying degrees of Calvinists, who adopt the “Perseverance of the Saints” tenet of John Calvin’s 5-point TULIP doctrine, which emphasizes the sovereignty of God over man’s choice in salvation. Scriptures that support this can be found in many books of the Bible. Here is a list if you are curious (go to the “Biblical Evidence” section). John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Societies that would later become the present-day United Methodist Church was a follower of the teachings of Jacob Arminius, who presented a different view from Calvin’s, which emphasized not only personal faith, but also continuing faith in God that was revocable by the believer. This article explains the United Methodist view on “falling from grace.” Scriptures in 1 John 2:3-9, Galatians 1:6-9, Hebrews 6:4-8, Hebrews 10:19-31 can be interpreted that the believer is subject to falling out of good graces with the Creator.
My creative mojo kind of just left the building!
Finally, teachings of a faith are not based on popular vote. It would not matter if the entire world decided that black is white--that simply doesn't make it so. Neither does any disagreement with Church teaching necessitate that the Church is required to change the teaching.
At least they now know that we are still around.
Andrew Clucas, Microgaming Poker Channel Lead commented: “Microgaming is pleased to announce the adoption of the Weighted Contribution method of rake calculation to the Microgaming Poker Network (MPN) which will change the way in which rake is allocated. We believe that this will result in a fairer method of rake distribution and improve the game experience overall for the greater majority of poker players.”
When we do this, I think we do it because we long to call the thing finished. We ache to put it in front of some sort of an audience. We've laboured over it for months or years. If it’s polished we can convince ourselves it’s ready to submit even when a little voice in our heart knows about the lurking problems. We know that, at least, it will look professional, from the micro-angle of the quality of prose. Nobody will be able to say it’s badly written, but will anyone want to read it?

According to researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, sugar is so toxic to the body that it should be regulated by the government. It’s interesting to think of sugar as a toxin; generally I would consider artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, which can produce negative health outcomes in individuals overtime, to be a toxin or evil. Perhaps other artificial sweeteners, such as Truvia, Splenda, Equal, etc, which my doctor suggested cutting out to reduce health problems.

I would like to introduce the company ‘PR Couture’, which operates the business related to fashion PR, Marketing and Social Media. I found this company by chance, while looking for someone or some organization to follow on Twitter. As a PR graduate student, who likes clothes, shoes, bags, etc. –let’s say fashion-, ‘PR Couture’ was MUST FOLLOWING subject for me. It was an interesting experience that finding some topic or information effortlessly in such a short time. A couple of weeks later, when I logged in Twitter, and @PR_Couture tweeted about job, and that was a huge appeal. Since, I had to flight back to my country within a month, which is why I felt sorry for myself and I decided to ask whether she knew about similar companies in Korea or Hong Kong. And a few minutes later, @PR_Couture replied me. Really? Such a big company answered my question within 10 minutes? It’s cliché to say, but I indeed realized the power of Twitter through this experience.

I made this card for this week's QFTD112 challenge which honors Wanda/cullenwr. I designed my card around this card I found in her gallery. I used the SB layered poinsettia die and real red card stock, sponging with chocolate chip ink and adding a pearl button. The leaves were done with PTI new leaf green. The tag was made using the Cricut, stamping the Contempo Christmas sentiment with versamark and embossing with gold ep. I embossed the background using a Sizzix Snow Globe ef, and added a touch of gold cording to finish this one. Another Christmas card added to my stash - I love that I'm getting ahead so early this year with Christmas cards!

I was impacted greatly by what I learned that day. Farmworkers are the men, women, and children who harvest 85 % of the fruits and vegetables we eat. They are excluded from many federal labor laws including child labor, overtime pay, a minimum wage, and the right to join a union. With few protections and with many occupational hazards such as heat stroke, pesticides, unhealthy housing, and working alongside dangerous equipment, farmworkers are one of the most vulnerable workforces in the USA. They are also faced with low wages, with a national average salary of $11,000. Here, in the southeast, it’s more likely to be around $7,000.
What TIME is it? TIME to pause and give TIME some TIME, before TIME decides to stop working on your behalf. TIME out for ignoring TIME, it deserves your respect. So join me as I give TIME it’s props for always showing up for me and making TIME even when I do not make TIME!

But when we heard that our former home had been struck by a huge earthquake it shook us to the core, no pun intended. We were thankful that we weren’t there, yet our hearts ached to be with our friends. We quickly learned that our teammates were safe, but it took until earlier this week to hear from our local friends via Facebook & e-mail that they too were safe.
The setting was Tékumel, a human-settled post-apocalyptic far future world, which Barker had been developing for decades with a similar in-depth approach to Tolkien. The world was terraformed and settled by human explorers around 60,000 years in our future, but then thrown - star system and all - into a pocket dimension.

In other news, my Dad (65) has discovered the internet, and of course- eBay. He's been ringing me up constantly giving me item numbers to look over and bid on for him. I've expressly forbid him from bidding on his own because it's dangerous- he can't even work emails yet! But he can search ebay and talk to my brother on Skype. He is a bit over-excited at 'how much stuff the Americans have' and how cheap it all is- yesterday's bargain was kerosene lamp parts that would've cost him a couple of hundred here, but he got 'em for $30. So you can see, I have to keep an eye on him. He did get me to buy him some reproduction advertising signs which lead to me buying this:

And once again it all boils down to emotions. Mainly one called regret. Next to unrequited love, the worst kind of emotion there is. Regret can seep into the very fibre of your being and poison you with its reedy little voice.
So I've had the last few weeks to process this information and get ready for the next phase of tackling it. Later this week I'll be getting a continuous glucose monitor to use in tracking my blood sugar levels at all times. It requires inserting something under the skin of my stomach, and I'll be wearing a device that resembles a pager to track it all. It's actually a really cool technology, and should help give me better information to modulate my medications as needed. And it comes in a purple case, so you can't beat that. I'm doing insulin shots with meals in addition to my long-acting nighttime insulin, and depending on how things go with the monitor, I will consider the possibility of adding an insulin pump. But one thing at a time - this one change is overwhelming enough. But as my friend Stephanie said, today it seems like a mountain. Soon, it will just seem like a blip on the radar.
It’s been a while since Kevin and I have had a chat, so go and get a cup of tea and settle down with us while I ask him about his novel, Lost Souls, his new publication company and why he’s chosen to self-publish.

Hello! I am here to share with you my remaining 4 layouts created with the May 2012 kit over at C'est Magnifique. The full reveal of the kit was posted today on the blog here- definitely go check it out! As of today there were a few kits left, so if you're interested in getting your hands on one, head over to the store here to check on availability!
Option (E) is, of course, the best answer. The others are nothing but rhetoric. The problem with rhetoric is “that’s all it is”. Rhetoric differs mightily from performance. And rhetoric is not a substitute for performance.
It's a pleasant book. The characters are consistent, it moves along -- I read it over a couple of days, put it on the shelf and forgot it.

For all us new bloggers out there, can you tell us how you got people to read your blog before the bonanza that was Ebay? And how did you learn to do all the extras on your blog like finding out how people found you on Google (I know you answered this before, but I couldn't find it!) and counting how many people visit your blog? Yup, compared to me, you're a technical genius! :o)
Sounds reasonable, right? The income part really isn’t hard. He writes down on a printed calender who paid him what on the day they paid him. That’s easy enough to enter. Except when I can’t read his writing.

The loss of control over Christianity and the prospect of large changes in Christianity frightens some White Western Christians. Used to their cultural expression of the Gospel being privileged above all others they are quick to accuse and label others expressions as poor misunderstandings of the Gospel, misreadings of the Bible or even heresy. In the Fuller discussion, Tony Jones very transparently admitted that this was his own reaction in regard to the rise of Pentecostal Christianity in the Global South. However, even many White Western Christians are beginning to recognize this cultural hegemony, the problems with it and the need for change.

TIP 2. Renaut also didn’t factor in the costs of installing a charging point. These used to be very procey but british Gas now provides then for £799, which means the electric van wins out again.
its not bad to keep asking and keep seeking and keep knocking. because in that process we draw closer to God and we see things from His perspective and we align our hearts with His plans and purposes. and sometimes i wonder if that is the point… that in the asking, seeking and knocking we find God, not just the answers to our prayers, that its all about the GIVER, not the getting.
The prince, who has remained unnamed but who was described by Nitzan as a "loyal regular customer", was sitting at the bar. He was approached by apparently rude plain-clothes police who demanded that he leave. When the prince replied that he wanted to finish his drink he was allegedly slapped off his chair by an officer.

This is cheap me at the store in the Christmas aisle: I pick up one of those beautiful eye candy Tree skirts and I admire it(insert pathetic look). I look at the price tag and I think "I will keep this until I die so it's okay to spend $65 on this." I stick it in my cart and before I am done shopping it's out of my cart because I can't make bring myself to purchasing it.
The Jiriki Kata-Do definition of the three battles of Sanchin leads one to a more comprehensive, eclectic higher state whereby mind-body unification (Zen-Ken-Ichi) is a mere stepping stone. The highest human state is only achieved when the energy of the universe that is external to the human is united and synchronized with the mind-body energy of the human creature. Thus, the inadequate state of Zen-Ken-Ichi should be more completely expressed as Zen-Ken-Kenkon-Ichi, or, “Mind-Body-Universe are one.” Zen-Ken-Kenkon-Ichi is, therefore, a restatement of the three battles of Sanchin advocated by my dynamic ideology of Jiriki Kata-Do.

Some were subjected to harsh treatment by other inmates, who pushed their heads into the toilet bowl while assaulting them, while others had to surrender their food as fights broke out in the cells during meal times.
I awoke to find that a man who I had always admired had passed away at 62 years (may 8th) Who was Lionel Edward Rose MBE ( 1948 -2011 ) He grew up in Victoria at Jackson’s Track and I grew up listening to the fights, he was a boxer like my uncle! He was the first Aboriginal to win a world title and he did this in 1968 beating Japans Fighting Harada in Tokyo! Mr. Rose was King of Moomba in 1973 and Australian of the year in 1968. I loved him, we all did. I am saddened by this news today!
At long last Blonde Redhead took to the stage. Wearing a white wisp of a dress matching her dainty demeanor, the arrestingly attractive Kazu Makino and equally stunning identical twin Italian brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace commanded immediate attention as they delved into the slow-burning “Black Guitar” off their latest effort, Penny Sparkle. Featuring vocal parts by both Amedeo and Kazu, the song took on a theatrical air backdropped by cool blue stage lights and dense fog-machine clouds as the two floated around each other during the vocal tradeoff.

Having completed the lengthy and completely unnecessary online application for job-seekers allowance (the dole), I was given a meeting at the Galashiels job centre to finalise the paper work and be officially on benefits. Its somthing I’ve done before. Many people dont know this but if your a student and dont have a job in the holidays the government actually give you money.

As I waited for my friend in the car, I could see, across some waste ground and half-hidden by a tree, an ambulance parked by the pavement in Creek Road, which runs parallel to the road where I was parked. The ambulance was facing the wrong way and a couple of paramedics were kneeling down at the pavement behind the ambulance, apparently tending to someone. I could see no other vehicles and no police car, so I figured someone had fallen down or had a heart attack.
As claimed on the TKDL website, "TKDL gives legitimacy to the existing traditional knowledge and enables protection of such information from getting patented by the fly-by-night inventors acquiring patents on India’s traditional knowledge systems. It will prevent misappropriation of Indian traditional knowledge, mainly by breaking the format and language barrier and making it accessible to patent examiners at International Patent Offices for the purpose of carrying out search and examination". Apart perhaps from the claim about "fly by night inventors", this all seems quite sensible and generally a good thing. After all, patents should not be granted for inventions that are already known.
There are 75 breweries in Pennsylvania. One of them is in a fish market; one is in a former county morgue; two are in old barns; one is in a train station; and one is in a suburban garage. The two largest American-owned breweries both have their main breweries in Pennsylvania, and they're less than 40 miles apart. Didja know all that?

I enjoyed a pint (or two) of this beer while packaging and it was quite delicious. There's an assertive bitterness, but a complex malt character that lets the yeast express itself. This is the second batch I've made with the Rogue Pacman yeast and it tasted more Rogue-like than the first.

Books are mere reflections of us, no matter what genre or what year they were written or what divinity they supposedly hold. Someone has observed something at some point that made them think, “Now why on Earth would you do that?” or “Gee, this will make for a holler!” Indeed, you’re probably thinking to yourself as you read this why I’m writing about observing other people writing about observing other people while your observing through the writing what sort of person I am. Still with me?
It just feels so nice to be able to sit down and let my characters flow from my pencil again.
Max Tegmark, astrophysicist, cosmologist and professor in the physics faculty at MIT in Cambridge, Mass likes the idea of parallel universes: the quantum mechanics (QM) paradox of a particle’s ability to be in two places at the same time. He sees mathematics as our ultimate connection to reality. “Math is not something we invented, but something we are continually rediscovering.”

As he makes his way over, Crow puts on a baseball cap to help hide his identity. In addition to this, he trimmed his goatee so that there is only a little patch of hair on his chin. He also grew in some stubble on the rest of his face, though it tends to come in as patches. In this regard, Crow has poor genetics. But since it’s at the stage of stubble, it’s hard to tell.
I wrote the things that were so excellent about losing 54 pounds, and I forgot the primary reason I was so inspired to start in the first place, the Horrible Heartburn! It was the reason I went to the doctor one year ago. It had gotten so bad, it plagued me not just at night, but all day long. If I leaned over to pick something up, I had stomach acid in my throat. The over-the-counter meds I was taking no longer worked. As soon as I lost the first 12 pounds, it went a way. It hasn't come back. I don't miss it. I even forgot all about it, enough to not remember to list it as one of the bonuses of losing some pounds. Wow. We had chicken wings for dinner last night, hot Buffalo wings. I didn't have even a trace of heartburn.

More than a quarter of a million children have been accused of racism since it became law, she said. Writing in Prospect magazine, she said: ‘The more we seek to measure racism, the more it seems to grow. ‘Teachers are now required to report incidents of racist abuse among children as young as three to local authorities, resulting in a massive increase of cases and reinforcing the perception that we need an army of experts to manage race relations from cradle to grave.
The Office Character Andy Bernard once said “The drama. I hate the DRAMA!” in an episode of The Office. But in this case, last night at the NFL Draft, I think as fans we can all say that “we loved the drama.”
“Is it based on real life?” (Yes, just like Agatha Christie’s many murders and Stephen King’s encounters with preternatural beings and events. What part of fiction don’t you understand?)
Diarrhoeal diseases caused by poor sanitation and unsafe water kill more children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined. In Africa, diarrhoea is now the biggest killer of children under five. Some 2.6 billion people across the globe live with no access to a safe clean toilet.

So, firstly, we have Nunez-Tesheira’s apparent decision that the information as to CIB’s financial crisis – wherever it came from – was solid enough to take immediate steps to protect personal interests. Apparently, the public, proper duties of that office awaited an official letter. I tell you.

Alas I am fully occupied with training a couple of colleagues, in fact the remote workers, oh the irony, and working on my French course so no time to chat about my favourite flowers, nor my sadness about being unable to be in France for May 1st as planned
So, working with the pool of data I do have -- 10 books in Select through Steel Magnolia Press, which is admittedly quite a small pool but is perhaps better than what many indies are armed with -- I charted how many downloads it took to reach a given range of Top 200 ranks during each month in 2012.
Another endless list, and another pointless activity to dwell on it. For it isn’t so much what has happened (or not) by the time we reach the twilight of our lives, but rather where our heart is as we make that transition from twilight to everlasting Day, where the Son is the Light and our tears are at last wiped away. If our twilight years were as perfect as heaven, why would we want to leave here and move on? Though it’s important to serve God and others until our last breath, we do so with our focus on the joys that lie ahead, not the memories or sorrows that tug at us from behind.
Obvious chocolate smell. This is not the chocolate you get from roasting the barley a certain way, like Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout (which is also a very good beer). It tastes like sweeter chocolate, and has an obvious cocoa taste. It's not over the top though, like Young's Double Chocolate Stout (which is not a good beer), and strikes a good balance between the desire for a chocolate taste but still having some semblance of beer flavor to it. Young's is like drinking a chocolate cake. Brooklyn's is like drinking beer with deep, unsweetened, dark chocolate. This is more like beer with a sweeter chocolate, but still beer. No discernible hops flavor, but the bitterness comes out a bit in the aftertaste. Great, smooth feel to it, because the cocoa gives the feel of lactose, without that cold lactose taste.
If I had been honest with my interviewer, then I would have had a truly successful interview. I would have been turned down on the spot, maybe even escorted out by security when I told them what I really thought of The LEAN Process and Six Sigma. My interview would have been successful because I wouldn’t have ended up in a job that’s not suited to my personality or my abilities.

Hopefully, when you are asked these questions and the many more that come up, you are able to answer confidently and knowledgeably. But what if you’re not too sure yourself?

We need to eschew this idealistic thinking and face reality. This requires Practical Reason which is to reflect on how life works and how people actually behave and what they are capable of doing to each other. Bertrand Russell regarded practical thinking as philistinism, but that is not what I mean. To bring millions of disparate people together is impractical and unrealistic and the silly metaphor of a melting pot shows how facile the plan is. To think practically about this would be to reflect on what is really happening from examples and, not propagandise people into thinking that wish would happen is happening. It is to consider the consequences of actions and not socially engineer people for a future utopia; it is not to pretend human nature is a social construct, but by accurate assessment of how people really behave to make wise judgements of others. It is a belief in wisdom which comes from living life, rather than learning ideology by rote and mindlessly repeating the right things.
I just kind of made it up as I went along, and I think it came out really sweet.
And here’s the problem, and I have learned this about myself from past experience, once I start writing the next book I will want to edit and tweak the first. Then I will want to draft out the whole series – which may be a few years worth of writing. Then I’ll edit and make sure they all at least match and don’t contradict each other, so perhaps add another year.

The free pattern for the afghan is here. I decided to go crazy and try a different color scheme, I think I like it so far. And here's Trisha's version, so pretty. I try to knit a row every night or so. At this rate I could finish by the time Amelia starts school.

I was doing so well with slowly trading flab for what resembled toned muscle and then I got a new job that consists mostly of me sitting in an office chair, typing legal documents and talking to clients all day. While on one hand, yay much better job, it sucks that I’m no longer on my feet all day, walking around and using muscles I forgot existed. Simply put, no work out built into the job. Which means I’m going to have to actually put in the effort to make a change in myself.
Most notable on this “provisional” menu was the inclusion of several savory items: Wafu Ribs (as served at the Food & Wine Festival last year), Karaage (Japanese fried chicken), Miso Soup, Edamame, and a few Sushi options… sounds interesting, huh?

Arguably, this turn in the political debate is a sign of how much trouble Labor is in. It is no longer trying to win over a majority and targeting the middle of the road swinging voters. It is trying to regain the confidence of its traditional base, and convince its core supporters that it hasn’t lost its Labor heart.
Before you attack my snobbish attitude, I'll just point out that I have actually done it and I am absolutely a writing slut - I'll write almost anything if someone is going to pay me.
Boehner said his offer that included some $800 billion in new tax revenue and massive spending cuts was never withdrawn. That plan was dubbed the “grand bargain” despite his decision to walk away from negotiations with Obama last week.

I liked the funny ears on this guy. The photograph makes his eyes look different because of the glare, but now I'm thinking that the eye on the right looks like it has a funny eyebrow... and I might try that intentionally next time.

Atheists have ramped up their efforts to gain greater respect and prominence in American society. While there are some non-believing organizations and groups that seek to have respectful debates with religious peoples, there are others that simply seek to poke fun at and incite the faith community.
Kelly was married to Betsy Blair for 15 years (1941–1957) and they had one child, Kerry. Kelly divorced Blair in 1957. In 1960, Kelly married his choreographic assistant Jeanne Coyne, who had divorced Stanley Donen in 1949 after a brief marriage. He remained married to Coyne from 1960 until her death in 1973 and they had two children, Bridget and Tim. He was married to Patricia Ward from 1990 until his death in 1996.

I do however LOVE the burning leaves on Insurgent and I’m a sucker for a purple cover!
It's been ages since I've done a big proper cake so I couldn't wait to get stuck in. The cake itself is a two tiered vanilla and chocolate sponge cake with chocolate buttercream. She loves chocolate so it was the only choice really.

A few days ago, on the morning following the big rain, I sat over my first cup of coffee at the old harvest table in our east facing kitchen thinking about bees and pussy willows and the riches of the farm. The field across the lane began to slowly reveal itself as daylight crept down the hill. Inch by inch, the first rays of sun ignited the billions of drops clinging to the tips of the new green grass. I took my coffee out onto the porch and slowly, decadently inhaled in the damp, cool, rain cleansed air. You could almost hear plants stretching and leaves unfolding. Three does suddenly hopped from the woods over the old stone wall half way up the field. Two were yearlings and the larger doe appeared to be heavy with this year’s fawns. As though enjoying the new wet earth, the young ones raced each other up the hill and back down over the glistening, spring green carpet, white tails erect with excitement and joy. C.S. Lewis wrote that “Joy is the serious business of heaven.” With the death of the dry spell and the new life of spring, I, too, felt Surprised by Joy.

Toads were rare but I’ve run across a few in my time. I remember driving home and noticing one in the middle of the road and this fellow must have been six inches wide – a wonderful specimen. I stopped the car and carried him over to the riverbank. There was one in our back garden a few years back which I dashed upstairs with to show Carrie. She says she’s rarely seen me as delighted over anything. And it’s true, I was. It was like being a wee boy again and we all know the wee boys we once were never die; they get swallowed whole by the adults we are forced to become but they never disappear completely.

I've been a busy girl today, but didn't accomplish very many things off my list. I haven't worked on that baby quilt and I didn't get laundry sorted and put away- both things that really need done. But I did have a bit of fun and got a few other things done.

The apostle writes of such a situation in Romans 7:24. “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” There is only one answer and one hope and we see it in the next verse, Romans 7:25. “I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” It is for this very same purpose Christ Jesus came into the world. In John 8:36 He said, “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”
The Lucky Lab, besides having an exceptional IPA, Superdog (I claimed it as my favorite beer to the AP, I'll stand by it), serves a limited release of single hopped IPA's, for educational purposes, I assume. They change roughly by the month, whenever the old one runs out. Right now the Lab on Quimby has a Cascade hops IPA, which I haven't tried yet.
“Amazing after all this time,” Xu Guan thought to himself. “How could a building like this have gone unnoticed? How could it still remain as it had been months before when the world came to a screeching halt?”
This was one of the best films to be released in 2011. Director Martin Scorsese shows audiences two things: how beautiful true 3D can be and where the magic of movies originated. Though the former point will likely be lost for most on home video, it is still a stunning film. While not typically known for family friendly fair, the master behind the camera uses his skills to tell a lovely story about a lonely boy and an old man who feels obsolete. The first half of the narrative may seem slow to some, but once they begin to put together the pieces of the puzzle it’s impossible to look away. Sacha Baron Cohen turns in a surprisingly good performance as the quirky station inspector, barely recognizable and quite entertaining. Ben Kingsley is wonderful as Georges Méliès, bringing a hardness to the character which is replaced by a warm charisma.

This exchange is discussed in greater detail in an important article by Ben Lewis on the Communist history discussions in London. The Lewis-Lih panel pointed toward the value of comparative study of the pre-1914 Second International and the Comintern.

I have to put "tantrums" in quotes because they're truly just about 30 seconds of screaming and crying - not bad by toddler tantrum standards. I'm responding by getting physically accessible to her (getting down on her level, holding her, etc.), using very very short sentences to empathize with her ("Play with stove! I know! Fun stove buttons!"), then waiting for her to calm down a little and redirecting with an explanation as appropriate ("No stove. Stove hot - ow! Look! Phone buttons!"). It's roughly based on the Happiest Toddler On The Block book, and thus far it seems to be working alright. I like that I take the time to empathize and be emotionally available for her without compromising my position or authority. Do I have any idea if this is more effective than any other approach? Nope. Do I have the patience to do this every time she doesn't get her way? Absolutely not. My other tactic is to ignore her, which I do when I feel like screaming right back at her. But I'm trying. I'm also getting better at seeing a conflict before it happens and heading it off.
The first page that I did in my book was taken from my favorite Florence and the Machine's song, "Dog days." There's a really great line in the song where she sings: "Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back." It's sort of how I feel when I discover I'm happy: it's such a surprise. So I did a page using that.
As you know, Jeff was bitten by a spider more than a year ago, but what you may not have known was that for a couple of days after he went to the ER, things were touch-and-go. There was talk that he might have to have his arm amputated, and we didn’t know if he was going to pull through at all. He was in a medically-induced coma for a few days and had several operations to remove the dead and dying tissue from his arm. So, understand, he was in really, really bad shape. It’s been about a year since he got out of the hospital, and since then, he had to learn to walk again, he’s had several painful skin grafts, he’s been in rehab doing exercises to regain the strength in his arm; but best of all, he’s been playing guitar. We were all excited when he joined us onstage for the encore a year ago at The Big Four show at Coachella. Since then, we’ve given him all the time and support he’s needed to continue his rehab so he can come back to the band fully recovered and able to deliver the kind of shows we all want him to. While Jeff’s been doing some writing and has been coming to rehearsal over the past several weeks, he has decided he needs to take more time to continue his rehab. While we want him back onstage with the band, all of us support his decision. So, we’re very grateful that Gary Holt will continue to fill in for Jeff, and will tour with us until Jeff completes his rehab and is ready to return. How long will that be? The best and most honest answer we can give you is ‘as long as it takes.’ We also wanted you to know that we’ve been doing some writing and recording for the next Slayer album – we’ve tracked a few songs, and will finish the album when we’re off the road later this year. Gary will join us on tour in Europe and the UK in May and June, and then we’ll all see you on this Summer’s Mayhem Festival.”

I bought the wine with some trepidation. First, at $8.99/ bottle it was slightly more expensive than my $7.99/bottle upper limit for affordable wines. Even with the 10 percent discount I received by buying more than six (mixed) bottles — which brought the final cost to only $8.09 — I still don’t like to spend that much on wine. Would Gaga Rouge be worth breaking my own rule?

Fairport Convention’s early years can best be described as a sequence of transitional periods. The years 1968 to 1970 saw a dizzying amount of line-up changes, stylistic shifts, and personal tragedy (a deadly post-gig van crash after which they nearly called it quits). In that span of two years they also managed to record several classic albums, each with it’s own distinct vibe due to the revolving door of key band members. While their early sound was inspired by West Coast psychedelia and singer-songwriters like Dylan, Richard Farina and Joni Mitchell, they gradually abandoned those influences in favour of a repertoire of electrified British folk songs. This culminated in the 1969 recording of Liege & Lief, by far their most celebrated album. That record (which I’ll admit I find it a little bit underwhelming) was touted as the birth of British folk-rock, and was highlighted by the celestial tones of singer Sandy Denny, and by spirited arrangements of traditional songs like “Tam Lin” and “Matty Groves”, till then unknown in the rock world.
What is it about those three words “I Love You” that people generally think of them as the healing balm to all and every problem? The solution to every situation? I mean, lets face it, “I love you” is the one thing you can say to every category of people in your life and somehow manage to get away with anything.
Sharia rocked forward and stumbled to her feet, and found an open pit where he once stood. Far below, the captain lay in a contorted jumble. She looked back to see the belt buckle, smeared with her blood, and noticed a small jewel, a ruby perhaps, depressed in its center. The ringing grew louder and she looked up to see the two remaining knights come stumbling down the hallway, clutching at each other like children, arms and armor momentarily forgotten. When they saw the princess they found their swords and their courage, and their eyes hardened into flashing diamonds in the flickering lamplight. Here was a foe they were worthy to face.
The one I had didn't get along with me. I tried baking cookies with that a couple of times and they always turned out burnt at the bottom. So I wanted a new one which I believed would yield better results. And boy was I right!
Along the way, Alex struggles through a landscape transformed by more than a foot of ash. The disaster brings out the best and worst in people desperate for food, clean water, and shelter. When an escaped convict injures Alex, he searches for a sheltered place where he can wait--to heal or to die. Instead, he finds Darla. Together, they fight to achieve a nearly impossible goal: surviving the supervolcano.

Other times, I would change one word or some punctuation and the story would improve markedly. I learned a lot about experimenting with the text.

Cranberry Seed Oil is rich in tocotrienols and tocopherols which are the two groups of molecules that make up Vitamin E. Studies have found that this oil contains the highest amount of tocotrienols than that found in any other vegetable oil. Tocotrienols have also been found to effectively protect the harmful effects of sunlight. It is also rich in Vitamin A.

Key in the Mavericks’ 2011 run to the Finals was Marion’s defense on any opposing player that Coach Rick Carlisle assigned him. In the Western Conference Finals against these same Thunder, Durant averaged 28 points a game on 42.9% shooting. Marion, not known for his offensive skills, put up 18 and 26 in games 3 and 5, respectively. If Dallas wants to make a run at upsetting the Thunder, Marion is going to have to disrupt Durant during key stretches like he did last postseason. Moreover, with Tyson Chandler gone Marion will be the one spearheading this defensive attack.

“Tango is more than just a dance or a sequence of steps. It is an expression of our emotions, an inner reflection of who we are and what we experience, a way to channel what we feel through movement. Tango is a language of expressing what we feel through motion, stirred in us by music, in unison with our partner. It comes into your lives in many different ways, as simple interest, a hobby, or a fascination… and ever so slowly it becomes an addiction.

Saturday: My whole family showed up at my parents’ house to celebrate my dad’s birthday. He’s 52. Yeah, just the twenty years older than I am. I know what you’re thinking because I’m thinking it, too: this is exactly what I’m going to look like in about 8 years. There’s no running from one’s destiny. I’m not the running type, anyway, but that’s more about laziness than courage.

I stopped to refuel 52 miles into the ride at a Freedom gas station north of Hudson, Wisconsin. I chatted a little with another cyclist outside as we took in our calories. I told him I was heading toward Stillwater and he cautioned me about the hill leading to the bridge just east of the city. "It's a nasty hill" he said. I tucked the information away. It would be good information to have. I headed off again.
At present, we have an unfathomable diversity of and an unprecedented ease of intercultural communication available to us, which those who are reading this right now are using at this very second: the internet. Because of this situation, and because of tools like the internet, syncretism is going to be a greater and greater reality to be taken seriously in the future. Again, this is not a bad thing, and offers a great deal to be excited about in the development of modern polytheistic theology and practice.

Clearly the Crown Office has not identified the parties involved, and no action has yet been taken regarding them, so it is appropriate to speculate as to whom, in and in relation to what, the police will be examining.
After the party was done and the boys were finally finished playing video games we headed home. Spencer kept saying things like, “That was just the best idea ever!” and "That was just perfect!" Even though Spencer turned 30, I feel like he is a 10 year old at heart. He loved seeing his family and being able to play video games with his brothers.

Lesson 2
Today may bring feelings of boldness and the desire to be outgoing. Your confidence allows you to express yourself more publicly than usual. Remember that being extroverted does not mean being overbearing, but being comfortable in your own skin wherever you are, and fearlessly shining your light for all to see. It doesnt mean we forget to be kind to others either, but perhaps we share our kindness rather than holding back. This energy can mean you smile at more strangers or even chat with them, or perhaps you might share a perceived weakness with a coworker without fear of it reflecting negatively upon you. It could mean you share that much-loved inspiration with someone who you feared might laugh at it or reject it, but now you can let it be heard without that fear.

The main reason I picked up this beer in the first place was fact that it was a Black Lager (I mean, how frequently do you get the opportunity to drink a black lager?). After reviewing doing a through review, the fact that it was a black lager turned out to be the least interesting thing about the beer! More interesting to me was the acronym GYO which paraded prominently around the circumference of the label. GYO stands for Grow Your Own and proudly proclaims that this beer in it's entirety is a product of the Rogue Brewing Company...

A great touch to this tale is the fact that the main bulk of the terror takes place on the other end of the telephone. Louis has to listen to the frightning events on the phone which is without a doubt the scariest element in the whole story. The reader goes through exactly the same as Louis; missing parts of the action and being left out of the loop. Brilliant technique. Applause for Monaghan on this. Loved this.

Of course I bought neither. I'm not one to buy things for myself right before Christmas (unlike my husband!). And I couldn't pay $30 for a candle...I'm way too cheap! I love scented candles, but they never have enough scent (probably because I'm too cheap to buy good ones).
Last week the training centre got in touch asking me to update the information on the course so that they could advertise it well ahead of time and possibly get more takers for this summer. In the meantime I had started to think about possibly offering the course as an online, moodle-based course. It seemed to solve the question of trainees having to stick around for an extra three days, pay for more nights in local accommodation and could possibly appeal to a wider audience.

The doors (and door frames) are too thick. The frames have to go on the outside of the wall, and stick out really far. If the doors were half the thickness, that would fix the problem. I tried to make this a positive by drilling a hinge through the wall and door tab to make an actual working door, to no avail. the thickness of the door and hinge tabs prevented any kind of swing. I would be happier if the doors didn't have the tabs and the frames were made of card stock like the windows.
Next to that was a smaller pool that we called the new pool and was one that was only five feet deep and usually used more by older members. Near the larger pool was a snack bar that sold potato chips, sodas and candy products and beside it was a small basketball court and a slab of concrete with one wall where some played handball. And scattered around the grassy areas were several multi-colored triangular wooden objects we called dog houses.

This book lacked any real direction or sustenance. Each chapter consisted of a little girl's prayer and a mother's reflection on her daughter's experience and perspective. I did not feel as though I came away with any added knowledge or value. However, I did finish reading with a smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart.
The amount of real food I eat isn’t much. I would eat 2 slabs of kit kat and skip dinner to make up for it. Or eat a slice of cake and walk home. My body is not getting the right nutrients because I’m such a junkie foodie. And worst, when I go out with my friends, it’s more cakes, more fast food, more nonsense.

Cue my move to Melbourne in 2007 and I found myself sharing a small apartment on Chapel Streets doorstep. There was no more loud music, backyard barbeques, no more gardens and no more pets, but I didn’t care. At 22 years old I was in the heart of everything and exactly where I wanted to be. I was working in architecture for a CBD firm and shopping, socialising, and partying within a walk, or tram of my inner city bed.

If the dagger gets into the wrong hands, it can be used to turn back time and rule the world.

Airplane seatbelts barely fit. I had to squish just a bit to get the belt buckled. I probably would have been more comfortable with an extender. I was always squished in the seats and my upper thighs occasionally even bruised a bit from the sides of the seats. I felt I had to hold my arms over my chest in order to not invade the space of the seat next to me and bother the neighbor who probably dreaded having to sit next to a plus sized woman. I always felt like a sardine on an airplane. I disliked flying exclusively because of my comfort level as a passenger.

Take the Italian Stallion Marella (I would use my nickname for him but ethnic slurs are discouraged). Aside from being his fourth title reign, Santino’s character is supposed to be Italian, as stereotypical as you can make him without giving him overalls and incompetent royalty. I say that Marella’s holding the title was significant because he, along with Sheamus and Kingston, are among some non-Americans who have held the title as of late. Does this mean anything for the belt? Not unless you fear communism.

This was the final Sunday of our Global Missions Fest--I didn't get to Church last week for Dr. Billy Kim (Korea) and the Korean Children's Choir. Had a minor physical "glitch" and had to miss. It was a busy final Missions Service, good music, good message, and Communion Sunday. We had some great reports from the different Mission Fields, and local Youth For Christ ministering. Lots of people interested in our Missions program.

Smith could have made an even stronger case had he pointed out the contrast with the current plans to develop the MTA’s Hudson Yards—with the city willing to solicit bids from developers—or the accelerated schedule for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, a process has raised qualms even among some project supporters, like Eliot Spitzer.
He didn't see the need to talk at me. I saw his anger leave his body replaced by a defeated slump in his shoulders. He left me standing there and went to get a drink of water. When he came back the defeat had vanished I saw sadness and somethings else...concern? And then he offered me a drink. That broke me. I was all tears. He should be furious. I pulled the ultimate leaving stunt I acted as if he were the bad guy when he came to save me. I was staying over a another man's house (although things remained completely innocent) and I had refused the very thing I had freely offered to him. My submission.

What I did not appreciate was the two young men who walked out of Herbergers at 3:30 a.m. this morning with two arm loads of Columbia coats that they had not paid for. Why? It is odd how a thing like that can make you feel violated. You didn't do it. You told someone about it (well, my mom did) but they still got away with it, it has an odd way of making a person feel dirty.

There is a dreamlike aspect to these stories: mysterious phonecalls are received in which the unidentified caller, a disembodied voice in the night, makes cryptic statements. Or a dying man gives a vague description that has to be unravelled.

It would have been useful had Ministers reminded voters of this pledge and given some vague hint of when the “later date” might arrive. Still, it remains Government policy, and the answer, therefore, to the question: “If we’re going to directly elect a mayor, how can we directly unelect a rubbish one?” is that, by the time the possibility arises, some recall mechanism should, as promised, be in place.
On Wednesday night, one of the churches in our little town had a Freedom Celebration that we went to. It's always one of our favorite things to do to celebrate Independence Day. They give out free hotdogs, popcorn, pop and icecream and put on a fantastic fireworks show. They also have a great band on stage singing terrific old and new Christian music along with jupiter jumps and free pony rides for the kids. What fun!

In one, I was driving a car in which all 72 of us were riding. I had no idea where we were or even where we were going, but I didn’t want to admit it, so I kept trying to get my bearings by looking at road signs. Because I was going a little fast, I missed a curve. We ended up in a large flat area and came to a stop facing the way we had come. Still not wanting to admit my ignorance, I said I was just turning around.

I am feeling a bit stressed about all the things coming up the next few weeks. A week long felting retreat to prepare for, for which I leave on the 30th. Come back on the 5th, a one day show on the 6th, and a show on the 11th and 12th. It may not sound like much but I am someone who lives a quiet, stay at home life and generally stresses about everything anyway. At least I feel good that I have been finishing things. Having a deadline can be good in that way.
5. Fucking in secret – having sex, masturbating, or having a guy masturbate me, right in front of people who have no clue what we’re doing, is an absolute fail-safe for making me cum. On a crowded subway train or bus, when everyone’s jammed up against each other, I often get my guy to start fingering me, because I just love the thrill of looking at other people’s oblivious faces, while he has his hand on my pussy. Even thinking about it, as I’m writing it, is making me tingle. It’s not exhibitionism, because if the person standing next to me suddenly realized what we were doing, that doesn’t excite me one bit. I think it’s just us knowing, that’s enough for me. That secret bit of knowledge, really turns me on.

There is only one place to start of course and that is the Emirates. Like in an alpine butchers, the stakes were high as Arsenal hosted Manchester City with both sides desperate for the three points. Arsenal needed to keep their noses in front of Spurs in the race for third and consolidate their top four place following last week’s defeat at relegation threatened Q.P.R., whilst Manchester City had to win to keep up with United in the title race. Yet you would not have thought it with City’s negative game plan. In the past two seasons, City have gone to the Emirates and parked the bus for two 0-0 draws, but you would have thought that they would come and have a go this time around with the title race hinging on the game.

Probably Thomas’ best-known song is “Fishing Blues,” a double-entendre, slightly ragtime tune that was famously covered by both the Loving Spoonful & Taj Mahal. Thomas’ own version is the final cut on Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music, & it includes one of Thomas trademarks—his solo on the quills, an African-American instrument that’s essentially a panpipe. A guitarist like Thomas could play the quills while he accompanied himself on guitar with the means of something like a harmonica rack. Although I didn't choose "Fishing Blues" for today's song, it worth a listen for sure. You can find it on YouTube here.

And yes, you can tell I’m all about books, since I based three separate silent auction theme packs around books. We’ve got the zombie one. We’ve got a Titanic 100th themed one, and we’ve got an awesome “beach reads” bag.

I am thankful I was able to see my doctor yesterday, and since this post was pre-written, lets just assume I'm thankful for good news.
Feminism, as I’ve discussed previously, was not originally about women being manly, shaped in the image of the revered and envied white male (that’s just what it became); it was about actual equal rights in voting (suffrage), property ownership, and employment. It got twisted, savagely and unrelentingly, by leftists who understood that women, like black people and every other invented and segregated “group,” could be manipulated to work against their own best interest.

Let me paint a picture for you. My uncle died in 19…98 I think. Since then my aunt had a nervous breakdown and became a recluse. She lost her job and draws disability so she never has to leave and in fact doesn’t go outside for weeks at a time. Since 1998 she has kept every single piece of mail, grocery bags, etc. I walk in and the only open spaces are pathways to the bedrooms and bathroom. Junk is piled up about five foot high in the air.
Note: if you are making this salad ahead of time, make the quinoa, fluff, and add the dressing while it is warm. When it has cooled to room temperature, add in the spinach, chick peas and parsley; toss, cover and chill. Before serving add the pears and toasted pecans. Taste test and add more seasoning if needed.

The glands are related to the purpose of renovation of cells, degeneration and also their rejuvenation. They allow not only the production of the potential physical energy needed by the body for its metabolic functions, but also cooperate in the production of energy to be directed to the mental and the spiritual bodies. Cayce believed that the endocrine system was a pathway to reach and understand God.

In the world of today, most of the caskets are made of steel. Since cremation is becoming more prominent, caskets made of wood are becoming more popular. Some people use them as regular furniture. I will tell you, once I become rich, my house will have mostly coffin stuff in it. Coffin couch, coffin cabinets, coffin coffee table and even a coffin bed. Yes, I will also have a hearse in the drive-way. =)

The sun is out this brisk morning in the Northwest. I have been wishing for warmer weather, but I will take some cloudless sky. Granted this rendition of Paisley isn't in cowgirl form, I guess you could say she is on vacation. I had to do something to get me out of the cold winter blues. "THINK WARMER THOUGHTS" As I am saying this, there is frost covering my deck. LOL
Disregarding the fact that it was the Dutch who had established the colony and that it was 'owned' by the Dutch East India Company, the first British occupation of the Cape began on 16 September 1795 when the Prince of Orange acquiesced to British occupation and control of the Cape Colony, and, by the time it ended in March 1803, the Dutch had lost their citizenship, and British immigrants seeking a better life in the 'colonies' had also begun to arrive.
Home Care Pulse, a company which measures client and employee satisfaction, created the certification program to measure key satisfaction aspects of its in-home care delivery as well as the level of satisfaction of the caregiving staff.

So then I ask if I can cut back to 1 weigh in a week, another quick no. Everthing stays the same. I know He is keeping me from back sliding, and that is a good thing. I just would like more wriggle room, not that wriggle room is usually a good thing for me, but it is nice to have.
In the 1980s the Thatcher regime sold the utilities and infrastructure of the UK. Arguing that it was not the job of the government to run utility companies, and that they would be more efficient under private control, the bonanza of privatisation was carried out. The constant rise in prices of the previously socialised utilities, have enriched the internationalist owners, but have not benefited the people one iota. Not only has privatisation led to higher prices, but also to worse services. This man-made drought is proof of the folly of selling the national infrastructure to rootless cosmopolitans who have no allegiance to people or country, and only see the financial profit to be made from raping the nation.

I lay in the darkness, listening to see what he would say or do to convince the dog that life was short and his even shorter if he didn't settle down. Nothing. Complete silence. No yelling. No talking at all, in fact. Nothing but the blissful peace created by absence of noise. I dozed off. I don't know how much later it was but Woody crept back into bed and wrapped himself around me, no doubt to suck the heat out of my body since he felt like a block of ice!
“It’s black,” whispered Tiffy, wrinkling her nose.
Whereas, for example, specifying all the names for every Sergeant and officer in a Space Marine Chapter (or company) is really very stupid, because you are telling people that there’s a definite version of the truth. Granted, it’s GW’s intellectual property in the first place, but it’s the fans’ creativity that made it what it is today.

And because each animal there is not only a different species but they are unique in there own rights. Ziggy a little donkey, loves the cows and got the zoomies when i let him go in with his cow herd tonight. Chewy a little goat closes his eyes when you stroke his soft fur. Pete , another goat can be sneaky and can fit threw the narrowest opening if i don't get that gate closed. He has a built in natural smile, just like our pigs. Carl , the Llama does look at me like a predator anymore and has accepted my presence. He no longer walks the pasture in front of me giving me his buck toothed evil eye. And Ellie the first farm pig there is a Princess but you should of seen her duking it out with Carl the other day. A little frail goat who i am told was such a brat when she was young, is now a shop goat getting special care. She likes oatmeal cookies the best. The horses sing to you when you get there in the morning and open the barn doors.
The Hoh are located right next to the Pacific Ocean in Washington state. The land is part of a rain forest, and the Hoh river runs through the land. Recent increased flooding of the Hoh river has resulted in water damage to some tribal members' houses, some of which have been on the site for 100 years.
3.American Indians, he is obsessed whit movies about indians and cowboys, that’s because, when he was little he could only go to the cinema to see movies and by that time the movies he liked were the ones of cowboys and indians. Now he has his own TV and still tries to see them 24/7.
He did a show called Good Ad, Bad Ad - and as far as I can tell he did the same talk every time. Being easily bored and lacking self-discipline I could never manage that. But I have always thought that showing examples of what is good and bad is better than waffling on about theory.
If you want to give your life to Jesus begin to come now… And as you are coming begin to call on God, ask him to save your soul, ask God to be merciful unto you, ask him to forgive you all your sin, promise him that you will serve him from now on… the rest of us, let pray for them, and intercede that the Almighty God who save your soul will save their souls also…. in Jesus mighty name we have prayed.

Risell and a group of investors purchased the Lion Brewery in November 2007. Together, they have facilitated the brewery's growth without sacrificing any of its work force, which consists of about 175 people. They have focused on restoring the roar of Lionshead and Stegmaier beer brands. They also pack for a number of customers, including other beer brands and soda.

Anyway, I looked up this ‘ultrasound liposuction’ and apparently it’s a new treatment from America, where a machine sends ultrasound waves into your stomach, which agitate the fat cells in the area (and not affecting other body cells) and breaking the membrane so they break down into Triglycerides and Fatty Acids. These are then removed from the body through your urine, via the Lymphatic system. The theory sounded reasonable, and there were several before and after pictures I found that looked reasonable to I decided to purchase the offer.

So, it's been just recently that I've been able to get out and about with my camera. But now that the warm weather seems to really be on its way, and the world is starting to turn green again (we already need to mow our yard!), it's time for more Photography Friday! And hopefully this year I'll remember to bank a few good pictures to use next winter.
it's very ironic that for both teams I'm leaving today, every card I've ever made for either team has won at least one contest or challenge. I feel a sadness that a part of my crafting history has ended....... but I do look to the future for the window that will open. :)

This exhibit stands in contrast with Mannahatta/Manhattan, another excellent show from 2009 which aroused New York history lovers. Mannahatta was map-based, but pure speculation, an imagining of what the island was like before European habitation. 'The Greatest Grid' starts from many of the same sources -- the Mannahatta Project was built upon early 18th century topographical maps -- but elaborates forth upon the present landscape with stunningly detailed drawings of almost every inch of Manhattan.

Ah, but I can hear some of you saying: “See there, atheism is just another form of religion,” to which I would say, “Define religion.” If you mean a faith-based worldview, atheism is not a religion. I would even suspect that, to most atheists, atheism isn’t even a means to end (as is most religions), but simply one result of a worldview that values evidence and rationality. In saying this, I don’t mean that religious people value ignorance and irrationality, but that they hold faith as a superior means of knowledge, at least in matters of religion. My challenge to them is: “But how do you know that faith is superior?” If they say, “Because I have faith that faith is superior,” they’re into an infinite regress.

Other than that, I am pretty much happy at my new places - home and office. The most important thing is, I love my craft room filled with all-white furnitures. A dream comes true indeed! It is actually very simple but I just love it! In fact, I spend most of the time in my craft room now than before. Happiness, happiness =)
I had an interview recently that was proceeded by two phone interview but so far no call backs. The photo is what I wore, coral jacket from Jones New york with an Anne Klein blouse and skirt from Winners. I am far from happy with my voice but I felt I did well in the interview, positive, enthusiastic etc. The interview was conducted in a boardroom by two women who bothy took copious notes on their laptops while I was talking. Perhaps they were just playing Skyrim. I was going to say Quake or Doom but that would date me even more than my taste in cars.
I got it easy though. I’m not a smoker nor a drinker.
Set in the early 1960s, "Sparrow's Flight" brings together two people from opposite streams of life. It presents the world from their point of view rather than the historical side. Will's patriotic duty vies with his longing to do right by the woman who has literally landed on his farm and crept into his heart. Natalya is enthralled by the clothes, food and way of life in America and has difficulty aligning what she sees with the Russian version of life in the USA. Will is kind and protective, unlike any man she's ever met in her homeland.

Maybe it’s because I don’t feel that I’m giving my writing the time and energy it deserves. I’ve become lacksidasical and unmotivated. I’d like to be able to push through it, but I don’t seem to have the right attitude necessary to stay on task and remain focused on the end goal. Because I’m not making the time for it, I often feel rushed or pressured into writing: and that doesn’t assist creativity.
Roger Waters tells the audience that the next song is about Syd Barrett (and he pronounces the last last name barr-ETT). For the first performance of the core of Wish You Where Here, it shows how much they rehearsed during the interim in live performance. The transitions between the two “Shine On” with “Have A Cigar” are seamless.

This is a very old self portrait (2008) of me trying to practice with a reflector towards the end of the day, you can see how a reflector helps, while its not perfect, it is much better, the light is less harsh. The aim of the reflector was to get enough sun on the shadow side of my face to match the side with the sun.

Our daily life is inescapbly mundane if we follow a regular routine –wake up, work, eat, rest. So as to enjoy this mundane routine, my friends and I do something different out of those necessary schedule. As mentioned in my previous blog, there’s a time at work that we pause for a few seconds to pose for a picture. That’s a wonderful few seconds break from stress and boredom.

The players come in at half-time disappointed not to be winning. However, such is the level of confidence at present, the game as a meaningful contest is effectively over once White Horse open the scoring from a header in the second-half. One goal soon becomes two, as White Horse begin to enjoy themselves, rattling the crossbar in the process. I decide to play my hand with a double substitution. These plans are slightly jeopardised when right-back, Sam Hewitt signals that he had a knock. I revert to a 3-5-2 formation, but in doing so I hesitate with exactly how I am going to reshuffle the midfield. White Horse's left-back seems to take pleasure in this. “Do you know what you're doing?” He asks. I didn't give him the satisfaction of a reply. One or two other players join in, as I quickly became the butt of their jokes. I had endured a brief glimpse into the daily life of Arsene Wenger, and I didn't care for it.
Leo, my bench mate and storyteller, says that he was working as the dispatcher at the town police station that night and that he took the call from the frantic Marshal. The Marshal had only lived in Red River for about 6 months and knew nothing about the events in August 1971 but Leo immediately thought of Mildred Packer when he heard the Marshal describe the blue dress that the woman in his headlights was wearing. Leo remembered back to when Mildred Packer had been buried. The rumor was that she had indeed been buried in the very blue square-dancing dress that she had been wearing when she took her own life.

As Congress and the White House squabble over lifting the debt ceiling limit, on April 22nd CNSnews reporrted that “Federal agencies reported improper payments estimated at $125.4 billion in fiscal year 2010, an increase of $16.2 billion from the $109.2 billion estimate in fiscal 2009, the Government Acountability Office said.” Fully 94% of those payments came from “social spending programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.” Maybe making a decent effort to stop wasting money would be a good idea?

But the more I learned about this Amnesty Day, the more I realized that it was a very strange amnesty indeed. The amnesty he granted turned out to be amnesty for himself. He wanted to assuage himself of the guilt he might feel at kicking blogs off his blogroll instead of granting amnesty to others to swarm across the border into his domain. "Everyone feels a wee bit guilty about removing blogs from their blogroll, so they're hesitant to add new ones to an ever-expanding list," he explained. So Atrios deleted his entire blogroll and disappointingly repopulated it for the most part with the usual suspects. Then others in the liberal blogosphere followed his example, including Jesus' General and PZ Myers at Pharyngula, who already takes a very Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest approach to blogrolling (see updates below). Then Markos at Daily Kos joined this ruthless bloodletting. "It sucks and it feels bad," he said, daubing the tears from his eyes as he typed. So the end result of Atrios' Amnesty Day was to make some blogrolls smaller and even more exclusive than they already were.
JW: My parents didn’t buy a lot of LPs, but they did buy some Herb Alpert & the TJB. My dad loved listening to the mid-sixties Ramsey Lewis Trio and anything by Anthony Newley. “Roar of the Greasepaint, Smell of the Crowd” was played a lot when it came out. The TJB was fun music, and not too complicated.
A couple of weeks later, I received a letter from Mark's agency thanking me and letting me know that they would like to work with me in the future. Enclosed was a check for a thousand dollars from Mark Farner. He had been impressed by my attitude. I had not paid Mark and his band and crew too much more than that to come to Knoxville. Mark had probably lost money on the venture as well. But of course there were the five people who came to Christ that night.

For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity. All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth? I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him? Ecclesiastes 3:19-22 (NASB)

Beer snobbery like all forms of snobbery is intrinsically ridiculous and snobbery has a long history of being ridiculed. From the wonderful “Keeping up Appearances” to “Dad’s Army”, the self set up of the snob via their own conceits followed by their downfall as reality bites has been a comedy narrative with origins that predate television or even the music hall. You dear reader deserve something of that calibre and rest assured I am busy working on it.
Two friends embark on a quest for a lost buddy. On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, a wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes impossibly out of control. As they make their way through the perilous landscape, another journey begins: their inner journey through memory lane and the story of their friend--the irrepressible free-thinker Rancho, who in his unique way, touched and changed their lives.
From our perspective, we just adore him and can't wait to leave tomorrow. We get to go meet him, spend time with him and bring him home with us.
And in doing so, we would find a way to keep our parents alive. We would find a way to return them to the glory they had once known. To renew their greatness. We would enable them to become the creators they had once been. When they had created us. And when they had spread through the galaxy.
We got through the door and I wasn’t planning on going any farther. I sat on the birth ball and leaned on my husband, then started begging for drugs. It wasn’t that it was so horrible… it was that I was convinced I couldn’t do it. I was still waiting for it to get worse! They kept telling me if I got into bed they would give me something, and I kept moaning that I didn’t want to move. I even tried to convince the doctor that if he gave me drugs, I would make sure my mother-in-law worked there as long as he needed her to! (In my head, I was trying to figure out how to break this to my mom!) Finally, the nurse agreed to

Then we made a set of little bibs. I've seen these cute triangular bibs in the shops, but all in bright colours. I'm a pink and pool kinda girl so it was time to get stitching. We used terry toweling on the reverse and a bit of velcro at the ends to fasten them.

The first thing to do is to expose and eliminate this absurd ethnomasochism.

Of course, we are willing to help, but always in their places of origin. And we’ll not allow them to invade our lands, collapse our economies and destroy our ancient cultures.

With the outbreak of the Civil War, classes were suddenly interrupted when the entire student body and many faculty from Ole Miss enlisted in the Confederate army. Their company, Company A, 11th Mississippi Infantry, was nicknamed the University Grays, and suffered a high casualty rate during the Civil War. A great number of those casualties occurred during Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, when the University Grays made the deepest encroachment into Union territory. Some of the soldiers actually crossed the Union defensive fortification wall, only to be killed, wounded or captured. On the very next day, July 4, Confederate forces surrendered at Vicksburg, Mississippi; the two battles together are commonly viewed as the turning point in the war. When Ole Miss re-opened, only one member of the University Greys was able to visit the university to address the student body.

Native Americans used juice from Goat’s Rue to catch fish. The juice contains a chemical compound called rotenone which temporarily stuns fish so they can be gathered by hand. Goat’s Rue has had many medicinal and household uses in the past. One of these, from which the common name is derived, comes from the practice of feeding this plant to goats in an effort to stimulate milk production.

Yeah, yeah, there are features, too. Honestly, they are rarely that good. I share Mick's philosophy that if a feature film is worth it, it will make it to wide release, but the docs almost never do. Seriously, some of the best docs ever were premiered here...like "Spellbound," "Crawford," and "Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns," just to name a few off the top of my head.
On the tweetspeak poetry blog a group of people led by Lyla Lindquist have just begun discussing L.L. Barkat’s book Rumors of Water.

What surprises me about Pollak’s assertion (although I’m sure you’ll tell me I should’ve seen it coming) is how completely fact- and foundation-free it is. He’s basically saying that President Obama is following in these leaders’ footsteps because he said so. Mind you, not that I’d believe him even if he said that he’d found a letter, signed by President Obama, that swore he would be the second coming of all these leaders.

Wallace Beery benefited from it. Paul Newman and Robert DeNiro got props for it. Sylvester Stallone owes his career to it.
Of course, you can't forget the documentary photographer of the time, Dorothea Lange! She photographed migrants, many who had come from Oklahoma, and used those photographs to show how badly these people needed help.
I've loaned him out to vendor booths at events, and we frequently do fund raising for various groups. When we work the Houston Eukanuba Shows, he's sometimes able to pull in several hundred dollars a day laying on the ground. The last time we attended the show, we earned 98% of what our rescue group got all weekend long. Mouse and I: 98%. Six other people and four dogs: 2%. Yep. I think he has a great method down. My dog is a remarkable oxytocin machine. He is available for rent and for social media consulting.
This jet black brew pours with a sturdy brown head you could almost walk across. It's a very rich oatmeal stout, with plenty of roasted malt goodness, with a little chocolate note and a noticeable oat character. For all that roasted malt, it's quite smooth and not all that bitter, creating a highly drinkable, yet substantial stout.
We arrived at Church, sat down and waited for the service to start. People were talking and walking to their seats and Kim was looking over his shoulder and so I eyed the same direction and saw his friend gesturing up until he sees me looking at him and then he froze. I was thinking okay…these guys are up to something but church started and nothing special was happening except for Kim who kept on looking at his phone and what it seemed like trying to hide the screen from me. I was thinking how rude, almost reading to give him a serious poke or pinch in the arm. He had just received a BlackBerry for his birthday you see and he was having a hard time letting putting it away, but common, in Church? I started to get really annoyed with him but I couldn’t really make a scene in Church could I? So, I tried to ignore him as much as possible.
I will shed light today about the healing therapy for bipolar disorder. I’m sure the bipolar personalities among you readers would find this news gladdening enough. The cure comes from yoga, and yes, it does heal the disorder completely, thus enabling the person to stop the bouts of schizophrenia.

I really liked this book! I was really looking forward to reading it, being a huge urban fantasy fan and having wanted to try out Jeri Smith-Ready's adult series previously, and it was so good!
The biggest shock, however, comes from the demographics section. Apparently I have the viewing habits of a young woman rather than a middle-aged man.

Obviously, labor advocates do not see the issues that way, and again, there is nothing wrong with that; from their perspective, and within the frame of reference of the issues – i.e., the unhelpfully-vague provisions of the Constitution – they are doing exactly what they should be doing. That does not mean, however, that their point of view is any more correct than the government’s.

Straigh out of the frozen, hoary wastes of Singapore (home of the equally crushing Abhorer) comes IMPIETY, who you are no doubt fully acquainted and obsessed with by this late in the Satanic-blackthrash game. Formed all the way back in 1990 (Abhorer formed in '87, for the record), these non-pious Hessians have always worn their primitive influences (Sextrash, Sarcofago) proudly on their lengthily-spiked sleeves, as evidenced by their original band name (it was "Sexfago"--lols).

I re-watched Ariel’s adventures recently (totally holds up) and I’ll be damned if I didn’t understand everything that little Gaulish caricature mutters. For all these years, I’d assumed he was just mumbling, but he actually says “Nouvelle cuisine, Champs-Élysées, Maurice Chevalier,” which is still nonsense but are actual French words.

Mana: She caused the apocalypse or something, I dunno. Her evilness was hardly explained beyond ‘because she touched the first crystal’ and was on the whole completely inexplicable. Her link to Inori was never fucking explained, so I’ll assume it was an awfully convenient coincidence. Or maybe, like Gai, she was being raised to be Eve. Actually, that might be it. Either way, Mana. WHAT was the deal with all the incest/shotacon stuff? There was just no call for it, and all it did was creep me out.

The limitations with this project were that I was attempting to work with floral blinds that are not at all to my taste, and a fairly innocuous mushroom carpet. The expense of replacing the blinds I just couldn't justify, so I had to find a creative way to work them into my style. They were originally part of a Shabby Chic meets Laura Ashley style of decoration that the previous occupant favoured. But it was just too insipid for me. After hours of wallpaper stripping, and a month or so of living with colour chips on the wall to aid in the decision process, I tossed the whole lot out and went on instinct with this fabulous blue. "Cossack Dancer" by Dulux. Not for the faint hearted, this colour caused many an odd look at the hardware store when I was asked what on earth I would be painting this colour!

I have been thinking since then about another self-help book I have started. (Don’t ask me if I finished the other two, I haven’t.) The question this most recent book is asking me is:
Seventh, as a result of point six, this election really and truly is (imho) the most important election in the last fifty years. We are standing at the edge of a precipice, and there is little time for turning back. Either our next president cuts programs, agencies and spending, or we go over the edge. This is not a time for merely standing on the sidelines. This is not a time for merely watching and hoping. This is a situation. ”Houston, we have a problem.” We must make drastic changes, and I firmly believe that any one of the GOP candidates will do a better job in Washington than Obama has done. We do not have a choice. We have a duty, and sometimes the duty of an American is a difficult one. Sometimes there’s not a “good choice” for getting out of a pinch. Sometimes we have to be willing to make tough decisions, and without a doubt, if it comes down to Obama and a not-so-conservative candidate, we must actually choose between the lesser of the two evils. God will change this world, and each election year where He gives us an opportunity to prevent immediate self-destruction, we must take that opportunity as He is continuing to do a greater work in our culture. And culture-building will make a difference.

As much as I love watching rugby, sometimes the physical aspect of the game depresses me. The fact that someone like Louis Deacon can win (at time of writing) 29 caps, despite having so few outstanding attributes other than the fact that he is massive, frustrates me. But when you see someone like Jason Robinson skip around these lumbering giants, you remember why the game is the attraction that it is. The sense of anticipation whenever he got the ball was greater than any other player I’ve watched, and tries such as the first test of the 2001 Lions Tour are moments that will live long in rugby folklore.

In connection with the affairs of Pattisons'. Limited, a telephonic communication received from their Leith office on Saturday afternoon stated the Company paid over £6000 of duty that day, and that business was going on as usual. It was announced in Edinburgh on Saturday that the British Linen Company Bank hold securities over Pattisons', Limited, to the extent of £100,000. Pattisons' granted a bond for a cash credit with a bank of £40,000 in December, 1897, and so late as the 3d of November last they executed another deed conveying additional security to the extent of £60.000 for a further cash credit. The total indebtedness of the Company to the bank on these bonds is thus £100,000. secured over the Duddingston Brewery properties."

I just wanted to take a moment to say thanks to all of you that took the time to send me a happy bday msg. Even those that thought “oh today’s Chad’s bday” I appreciate the thought. Some people may want things and stuff for their bday but for me to be alive for another year is just enough gift for me and to be able to share it with my family and friends, the ones I love and care for is just enough for me. I’m not trying to sound like I’m so much all that cause I ain’t but that’s just how I am. I’ve lost many friends and family that isn’t here anymore and you cherish things that are more important than a bunch of gifts or big parties. I cherish the people that’s in my life that I’m connected to. Thank u all again for the bday love. I really appreciate it

In the book, Katie walks you through the journey of her life, from her "riches" in America her old home, to the "riches" in Uganda, her new home. It really put a lot of things into perspective, and reminded me of just how comfortable we are here in America. I have ran into a lot of people in the past, that say things like, we have to take care of our own people. Why worry about people in Africa too, they are not our responsibility. etc.. But, if you take God's word literally, you will find that, that way of thinking is actually very off.

But scratch the surface in Trinidad today, and you’ll find a whole slew of rum songs, many recent variations of a popular hybrid Subcontinent-goes-Soca style called “chutney.” (About forty percent of the population of Trinidad is of Indian descent.) An article on the subject recently ran in the Trinidad and Tobago Express under the headline “Rum and chutney the latest Carnival drink.” (Having made cocktails using rum and raspberry preserves recently, my first thought was, “Well, this sounds interesting!” Then I clicked and remembered. oh, yeah, chutney, the music.)

Which brings me to reader expectation. Readers want good stories. They expect to be able to get them. You want reader expectation to be high. If they perceive value, they’re willing to pay more. Self-publishing has been working against this perception of value. Let’s face it, one doesn’t expect much for a dollar. It’s an impulse, throw away value item. One doesn’t expect much for a dollar and one isn’t terribly disappointed if one doesn’t receive much for that investment. Self-publishing is playing off this idea of giving a valuable item at a throw away price in order to generate interest in the product.

Honestly I think men do this b/c its nature vs. nurture for them. I believe b/c men are much more practical and typically straight forward they have a hard time reading subtle hints and non-verbal cues and non-direct forms of communication from women especially. And this is how a lot of guys get turned down or friend zoned and later confused at “what happened” when he dropped the hammer and the girl suddenly has to tell him directly “I don’t see you in a romantic way”.

«Hidden Heart» will combine their career paths in the respective political context. The goal is not to assert that Naki could have been a Barnard were it not for Apartheid. Yet the goal is to work out undeniable parallels in the character of the two men, to show the possibilities for professional development within the political system and the way they each dealt with it and what they made of it. And finally, the film will attempt to show how history can be rewritten when a system seemingly cemented in place for eternity, falls apart.

23. Given the far-reaching effect of recommendation 12, and that anything can be deemed to be racist, recommendation 57 is especially worrying for the police, since it provides for disciplinary proceedings (‘such conduct should usually merit dismissal’) to be used against police officers who have been shown to have used “racist words”. PC Steve Hutt, who referred to a black youth struggling, while being arrested, as a “black bastard”, was one of the first victims. He was sacked after many years of exemplary service. See, ‘Sacrificing of a First-Rate Copper’, Daily Mail, 1st March 2000, pp.18-19. Contrast Hutt’s sacking with the fact that another police officer, Detective Constable Colin Goring was not disciplined even after admitting that he had a cannabis and cocaine habit.

In the bonus round each team takes turns naming one item. If you are wrong, then the other team has to name one. If they can, then they win. If they can’t , then it starts all over again. The other team went first. I can’t remember what the headband kid said, but it was wrong. It was some name that I had never heard before. Jessica and I looked at each other, puzzled. I knew models, but I wasn’t for sure who had been on the Sport’s Illustrated cover. Jessica wasn’t sure either. I was like, “What the heck”. “Elle McPherson”, I said. We were informed that we were correct. Another win.

Demjanjuk was convicted, and in 1988, he received a death sentence. In most countries, that would be the end of the story save for the line about his death by hanging or stoning, but Demjanjuk wasn’t convicted in “most countries.” He was convicted in Israel—one of those minority nations that has a workable justice system that isn’t directly ruled by hysteria or a drug mafia.

HERBAL TEAS. Commercial products like horehound tea will provide relief. For brewing tea at home, 1 cup (250 ml) of boiling water is poured over 1-2 teaspoons (4.5-10 g) of an herb. The tea is steeped for about 10 minutes and then strained. Generally, up to 3 cups of tea may be drunk daily.
I read. A lot. Or, I did read a lot but then school actually started to get stressful and my bookshelf started to seem unappealing. YA lit…YA lit everywhere. Except for a couple of novels, like Harvest and Animal Farm. But I’m pretty particular about the books I read. I won’t read books about spoiled children who constantly complain about being too skinny, I won’t read teen romance novels (what is even the point of those anyway; everything’s been done already), and I won’t read thousand-page epics about crazy old men who run at windmills.

In particular, the midfielders do not contribute enough goals. Arguably, if Arshavin had scored ten goals he might not be winning league titles with Zenit. A look at the scoring records indicates the point; van Persie stands proudly at the top with 35. The next top scorer is Walcott on 11, 46 between the two. The remaining twelve goalscorers manage 40 goals between them. It is not a healthy balance behind the Dutchman.

I've learned this program can work a couple different ways.
As they share the same dialect and culture as local Chinese, they will have fewer problems integrating into Singapore society as compared to Chinese from far-flung inland provinces who come from a completely alien world altogether.
Following the Telegraph’s investigation last year, the four major exam boards in England and Wales were required to carry out their own internal reviews of all training and guidance for teachers.

A couple of months ago, my sister LC came out for a weekend to visit Miss B and me while DP was off doing his thing for the month of March. As usual when LC visits, much jollity ensued, as well as copious amounts of goofing off. Our joy was unrestrained when, on Saturday morning, Miss B’s soccer game was cancelled, allowing us free rein to gallivant into Kansas City and carry out the following agenda:
‘Looking forward to it?’ I say, just eyes and nose visible over the four duvets, still shaking off the turquoise waters in my mind.
Morning all, I hope this finds you all fit & well? Anyone else noticed the fact that all it's done since the hosepipe ban in the U.K. is rain lol?! Go figure!! I had my OH at home to do the school run yesterday & it did that typical thing of raining just for the 20 mins you need to be out......I was so pleased to stay in, can't say OH was as happy as me though lol!!
Rosie Chauke, a youth coordinator from Radio Dialogue says her duties include working on various projects. “We have activities such as debate camps, drama competitions, talk shows and public speaking competitions for those youth that are still at school,” said Chauke.
I have to blend it, be actively looking for work- in moderation- and not stress over it to the point where I will get an early heart attack. I realize even if I had a job, not all my problems will magically go away. The future is always going to be uncertain, I could be transferred to the moon! Or perhaps my best friend across the country might move over here! Or I might be so busy I may not have time for a social life at all! Who knows!
MY SISTER, LANAE, and her husband, Dale, were giddy as two kids in a candy store when Dale walked in with the net bag plumped with a dozen morels.
"I know what that is. It's play-doh!" I said.
Xypherous: I didn’t do anything.
He said he’s excited about what God is doing in response to the violence – so excited, in fact, that he isn’t frightened and doesn’t want to leave.
Dotted around the the northern and eastern sides of the island are several smaller plots of land. These smaller islands, or cays, are alos popular as day-trips for tourist who want another option for a beach. We visited Rocky Cay on afternoon, unique in that a sandbar makes it possible to reach the islet on foot without fear of wetting one hair on your head. This shallowness was not a friend, however, to the shipwrecked boat moored just off the shores of the cay.
Farrah Faucett hair-do days
As if nature didn’t present me with a big enough gift/surprise with seeing deer in our woods the other day, Katie and I were treated to another gift when visiting my Mom. She was having a good day. A really good day.
You can see this concept in action if you go watch this video:
The surprising thing about Lonely Island is that for a comedy act, they make pretty good music. This song, mocking the OTT love songs poor Michael Bolton has sung through out his career, deserves this spot for two reasons. One, it really is an incredibly crafted song with great raps from Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone. Two, Michael Bolton sings the line ” This whole town’s a pussy waiting to get fucked”. Every time I hear it, I begin to howl. See, in order to become cool, dear sir, you had to get away from the “Time, Love, And Tenderness” bullshit and be freaking hilarious. Now back to the good part.
Epic Fort Making
And those little suckers are quite heavy - in fact that's one of the key indicators of a good truffle, that it's heavy for its size. You also want to check it has been brushed clean; dodgy vendors have been known to stuff cracks with mud to increase the truffle's weight. It should also be free of soft spots (hence all the fondling) and have a strong truffle-y odour.
I have to confess to something today... Where to stay, is the big question I try and avoid...
Another name I came up with over the weekend was "My Husband Wants the Farm but I'm Reluctant" Farm. Not catchy enough though. ;)
In May 2008, an angry motorcyclist punched a kwaZulu-Natal provincial VIP driver after the VIP driver crashed into the back of another car, seriously injuring its occupant, on the N3 near Camperdown.
However, De Klerk's sudden decision to abolish apartheid in 1990 and to offer the exiles full democracy completely destabilised the Party and its strategy. Suddenly the slogan, so often repeated, about "the seizure of state power" was out of date, as was the armed struggle and many more such shibboleths. Before long, even nationalisation and socialism were gone, or at least indefinitely postponed.
Have a great day!!!!!!
Identify what it is you want, or don’t want for that matter and get clear about how you would like it to be. It is important to be specific. If your intention is to achieve a goal simply to “achieve it” then your probably not on the money. It’s the journey of going through the processes of the goal that makes up a big part of feeling “fulfilled” at the end of it. If your not happy with a certain area of your life then ask yourself, if you could be happy, what would happiness look like? A goal can be anything that matters to you; getting a new job, a new car, having a baby, getting married, finding love, loosing weight, getting healthy, buying a new TV, owning your own home, buy stocks, start a business, improve your inner balance, improve your relationship, make X amount of money (hint: what do you want the money for, that is, what will it bring you?), start a charity, travel, change your hair colour, make a new friend, finish a book, write a book, master a cooking class, stop using drugs or alcohol, get your drivers licence, get into college or university etc. etc. etc. The list goes on and on. So, what do you DO in step 1? Start by putting on a piece of music, something inspiring, grab your success journal and a pen, close your eyes and visualise exactly what it is you want. Spend a few minutes really getting clear and then start writing everything you want, all the goals you would like to achieve in the next year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, define your life on your terms and dare to dream. Even if you don’t believe you can achieve it, write it anyway, have fun with step 1.
Hey my lovely readers,
He was slightly out of breath.
Yes, I do wish I had studied. But I know that Allah had His own plans for me. That they didn’t fit in with my own plans for myself, well that was something I’d have to make peace with.

B2. You Can Choke Like That
So, last year, I was going to blog about some old-school stuff we had in the house that I love so much that I will never part with them. One was a toy, another was a CD and the last was a book. This particular book is called “The Sick of Being Sick Book”. It’s one of my favorites because it’s a unique book of humor and quips about how to be sick when you’re sick. The reason this book played a big part in my life was because, well, I was always sick. I had asthma as a child and usually spent time at my Grandma’s house on sick days so my mom could still go to work. “The Sick of Being Sick Book” was one of my favorites to bring along with me and so I read it over and over and over. As I said, I was going to write about this book, a CD and a toy last year, but then the holidays hit and the three items were just sort of floating around the house. Not literally. That would be creepy.
i just realized that today is my blog's birthday.
OK…what is Zen Studios Pinball?
So when I saw a recipe on-line a while back for making paneer cheese at home, I cut and paste the recipe to an email, sent it to myself and archived it. What I cut and pasted is below this post. I'm sooo sorry to the blog where I found the recipe because I can't for the life of me remember where I got it.
Alison's Pantry just started carrying some freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, Jeremiah and I downed the Pineapple! It was so delicious and a healthy snack! I was so excited because fruit is hard to feed a 1 year old, but these are just perfect! They are located on the bottom of page 27 in the #8 flyer!
My love affair with mermaids began when I was eight years old and saw the movie Splash for the first time. From the moment Daryl Hannah swam into view, with her gorgeous blonde hair and magical, life-saving kiss, I was hooked. Right then and there I knew I wanted to become a mermaid. Sadly, the closest I ever got was a career as a competitive swimmer. I would spend hours in the pool every week, wishing my legs would magically turn into fins. It was that same fantasy that, nearly twenty years later, led me to the story idea for Forgive My Fins.
This might be my first foray into Sportsgirl, but so far so good!
When I designed the sketch I thought of a round shaped card but it can be interpreted other ways too. I love this paper from My Mind's Eye and of course my Spellbinders!. I think between the stamp, sketch and paper this one came together pretty easily :)

Fred Singer, president of the Science Environmental Policy Project and a skeptic of man-made global warming theories, warns that the consequences of tinkering with the planet’s delicate eco-system could have far-reaching dangers.
“She may well have been drinking, GB, but she wasn’t lost. Some despicable forger put a note under her door inviting her to my quarters. She barged into my cabin and took off her gown before I could say a word. I had to throw a sheet around her! Here’s the note she got – read it yourself.”

Now I would be a terrible host and have a totally lame party without foods and drinks. So help yourself to the goodies that are out. Lots of noms, drinks. Just remember kittens, milk or water only until you are one year old!

“Wallpaper” is the term used in Microsoft Windows before Windows Vista (where it is called the Desktop “Background”), while Mac OS Xcalls it a “desktop picture” (previously, the term desktop pattern was used to refer to a small pattern that was repeated to fill the screen).
Readings for Friday, March 2, designated by the 1979 Book of Common Prayer: Gen. 40:1-23; 1 Cor. 3:16-23; Mark 2:13-22; Psalms 40, 51, 54, 95
So I guess the reason I want to write is because I have creative urges that I want to put into something, and ideally something which is greater than the sum of it’s parts. I’ve been lacking in confidence, in my ability to do that, in devoting time to doing that, and therefore just a general drive to start and finish that. I write the blog for practice, to up the quality stakes a tiny bit, for commitment, to test myself in different aspects, and now for the fun. I’ve a rough idea where the blog is going, but excited to see what destinations it arrives at, and what stops on the way. But I don’t see this as my only output, my contribution to the writing world, just the gateway to find another. So what reasons do you write for? If you run a blog, why do you write it? I seem to have worked out why I do mine.
If only today looked like this! It's been raining all day... so sad because I'm so pumped for spring already. So tired of coats!!! It's time I put my fur and wool away for the year.

Visible Voice Books, located in Cleveland opened back in 2007. It’s a independent bookstore that sells new and used books, if something you want is not available they will order it. Events such as author book signings and open mic are a regular thing there.
And to a small child, seeing a violent act without the real-life consequences of pain and emotional hurt is totally normalizing that behaviour and making it seem like it's not big deal.
At its unleashed peak — as first heard on 'Birthday' — Björk's singing communicates an ineffable alloy of mixed-emotions, a mad jumble of astonishment, elation, rapture, dread, awe. Debut is drenched with just this goose-pimple-inducing stuff. The title of 'Violently Happy' captures the Björk effect perfectly: a gush and rush of euphoria, a tidal wave of oceanic feeling. Over the song's brisk house beats, Björk stammers as she struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin: "I'm driving my car too fast with ecstatic music on/I'm daring people to jump off roofs with me." In the end, she and Mr. Hooper resort to studio wizardry to gesture at inexpressible feelings, sampling one syllable and turning it into a stuttering vocal tic.

This recipe has a lot of spices that you may not already have. There is an Indian spice called Garam Masala that contains Cinnamon, Cardamom, cloves, and other Indian spices. You could probably buy the one spice to avoid buying many of the ones listed above.
It was reported that the Seriake Dickson administration has set up a committee saddled with the responsibility of ensuring the returns of all missing government properties in custody of members of the former administration.
Even when things turned to the better and I was able to go to school, things would get in the way with my bipolar or my physical problems like my spinal pinch or feet problems from the sudden weight gain. Or the season would shift and I'd have to adjust my meds because of a sudden manic flare up. Curve balls come every way, no matter who you are or what you're dealing with. That's just life.

I thought the book was very interesting, although I don’t think many people would want to read this. If you are at all interested in the medical field, you would probably like it.

I wanted to write a short note to all of you saying how much I have enjoyed and been inspired by BASNCR over the past four+ years. I was astonished to find such a wonderful and thriving botanical group when my husband and I returned from our last overseas post in 2007; it’s been a pleasure knowing and working with all of you.
“I don’t know what he smells like,” I said, “but it seems to bring out the female gorilla in women.”
However, after a recent and successful bid to forgive foods that in my earlier days were labeled inedible, I decided to make an "All" beetroot dish! A fresh, vibrant, sexy, beetroot soup.
I must say I had a bad experience to begin with: I downloaded a PDF I needed for research, and it was hopeless: when the screen showed the whole page, the print was impossibly tiny, and zooming in gave me a frustrating section of a page only, whereas if there was one thing I needed to do with this document, which was the report of a tribunal, it was scan whole pages and skip. I ended up printing out the whole hundred A4 pages, which gave me the chance physically to divide it all up, and put together the sections I really needed, and mark bits with different coloured highlighters according to order of importance. Well, that was a PDF, but then when I came to download a novel next, I discovered that that ability to skip back and forth is crucial to my reading of novels, and it wasn't so easy on a Kindle. Get to a point in a novel which refers you back to an earlier moment which you then want to glance at again quickly, and with a paper book you can usually do it in an instant by remembering how far the book was physically open at the time. Try that on a Kindle, and you're pressing one button after another, and your reading experience is suspended and clotted... And I know some people think it's sacrilege, but I like to scribble copious notes in the margins at top speed...
“The Gold Watch” opens with the memory which places the extraordinary importance of the talisman with both the boxer and the audience. The boxer wakes from this like it’s a nightmare. He then pulls off his scam and safely escapes. There will be no possibility of conflict between him and the kingpin, he has escaped, and is in a safe place. In the middle of this sequence, the boxer wakes again from a horrible dream, presumably, again, of the gold watch. He sees the violence on TV, what the audience expects and wants from these types in conflict. There is no reason for the boxer to leave his safe place – except for this implanted memory, designed for the purpose of him going on what would otherwise be an irrational quest – the retrieval of a simple watch from his house, even if it means great possibility of harm, but which will fulfill the ends of the structure: bringing him into conflict with the kingpin. When I see the boxer wake from his nightmare each time, I see a reaction not just to the memory itself, but that the memory is there almost arbritrarily, alone, in order to drive him into conflict. It is something like a science fiction film, where a character’s memories have been implanted so he acts according to the purposes of some shadowy, sinister group, the character vaguely aware that there is something of design, something not entirely his own, to these memories.

Start from the Maxwell natural area parking lot (coordinates: 40.555931,-105.143823) and head south on the trail. When the trail splits at Dixon reservoir keep right. The trail will take you along the side of the ridge, almost to Harmony road and loop back around the other side of the lake. Part of this trail was closed due to muddy conditions when I went, so I had to cross over to the other side of the loop.
It's Mother's Day. I think it's my 5th Mother's Day. If you're a mother that works outside the home all week than I'm sure the best thing you can think to do on Mother's Day is spend time with your kids. I get it. You don't see them as much as you would like during the week. It makes sense. I'm in the other boat on this one. I spend all week engaging my children on a mad hunt for new things to do. I seem to always fail because my kids like to do the same things over and over. I honestly think I could draw you a friggen blueprint of the B&O Railroad Museum because we have been there so much. The boy likes trains, so we go whenever we can and seriously, it is drudgery for me. I feel like a zombie when I'm there but they both love it. If it were up to Owen, we would go there daily.
Soak for about one hour in a large bowl of cold water in the refrigerator.
The highly nutritious purple sweet potato is the latest food item to be presented to the general public as a potential superfood. The colour is the important part as it is this purple colour which is responsible for the amount of anthocyanim in the potato. Anthocyanim which produces red, blue or purple colours in different types of food can also be found in blueberries, red grapes and red cabbage. However, the purple sweet potato has a higher concentration of the chemical than any other species of potatoes. This is effective for lowering hypertension and is one of the best foods that one can eat to prevent cancer.
The Church requires you to attend confession at least once a year. However it is a good spiritual practice to go to confession more frequently, at least every month or so.
If the theatre is completely packed, and there is not a single empty seat in the house, then, yes, I understand when a complete stranger sits directly next to me. But when there are ten thousand empty seats, why would you not give me, at least ONE FUCKING SEAT of buffer zone. Seriously, it’s like when a dude chooses the urinal right beside me, when there are so many other urinal options to choose from. These people need help.
I don’t remember if I asked my sis-in-law whether she’d be telling her Mom and Dad about the autopsy results. I know she never told them, and what I found very strange was that my mother-in-law never asked. I couldn’t imagine having lost my son and not wanting to know how he’d died, but she never asked me and I never brought it up. To this very day I don’t believe she knows. Again a lesson in how everyone is different.
I’m glad whenever I can share her laughter
I can’t wait we are going to go to the temple, the beach, a Padres game and the Zoo. I can’t wait to eat a hotdog at the Padres game.
Things have been hoppin at our house as we are adding two decks and a garage this spring, my daughter is a senior and we have all that stuff to enjoy and my nephew is getting married (holy cow am I getting old). My daughter and I attended his fiance's wine themed bridal shower this past weekend and I wanted to show the card and wine bottle deco I made.

The Chief Scientist also explains that in some cases the specimen's conditioning wares off enabling them to pass through the barriers into the different zones and form resistance groups. The Chief Scientist demonstrates his new conditioning machine on the captured Carstairs. Back in the Barn the resistance (made up from soldiers from different times) arrives and captures Von Weich.
Meanwhile, Blogger is putting my pictures and words in weird, uncontrolled- by- me, places. Apparently I am not quick to adjust to the new style/features. I feel confused. I am truly not computer savvy and do not like it much when things change. Why does my text keep showing up as a link??

As long as he maintains a tenuous hold in the battle for the nomination, Rick Santorum will be stoking resentments for votes from descendants of “men and women who worked and scraped and clawed so their children could have a better quality of life” against their presumed enemies in big cities and offices.

Last month I grabbed my bubble wand - my desire to write and encourage women for Christ - and started blowing bubbles. I put God at the focus of my blog - not myself. I sent out a few submissions to Christian organizations to be published. I started writing an online bible study.

“Arrived in Portsmouth, Shardlake and Barak find themselves in a city preparing to become a battle zone. The mysteries surrounding the seemingly normal Hobbey family nineteen years before, involved Shardlake in reunions both with an old friend and an old enemy close to the throne. Events will converge on board one of the king’s great warships, gathered in Portsmouth harbour, waiting to sail out and confront the approaching French fleet…”
Maarten Stekelenburg is the final candidate and is considered, from unnamed sources, the number one priority for United. Stekelenburg has worked with Van Der Sar at International level and has spoken admirably of him to Ferguson. The Ajax keeper shares similarities in that they both have played for the Amsterdam club and risen through their infamous academy, whilst also both have pulled on the orange jersey of Holland. Stekelenburg has the advantage that he has contested in a World Cup final and thus is used to big game scenarios.
I am very sad to announce the loss of my dear Mother. Her funeral took place today and as we mourned her death we also celebrated her life of 89 active and healthy years. Survived by four children and their spouses, eight grandchildren and the spouses of five, and twelve great-grandchildren, she was well loved and cherished by all.
It includes several varieties of lettuces, and plenty of greens: spinach, swiss chard, collards and kale. Peas and carrots, radishes and rhubarb, and berries for dessert will also be on the menu, along with some standard fare herbs and some more unusual varieties such as anise hyssop, thai basil and sorrel. Camomile also will be grown…a favorite tea maybe of the First Family? Edible flowers such as nasturtiums and marigolds will border the raised, organically fertilized beds, along with zinnias, for cut flowers. And to top it off, a White House staff member will also tend two bee hives for honey.
Lastly, we cannot but note that respondent’s conduct relative to the civil case in question likewise fell short of the diligence required of his profession, in violation of Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which demands that a lawyer shall serve his client with competence and diligence. Rule 18.03 of said Canon further states that a lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable.

Well...hello again, my lovelies!! I've been a busy little mama . . . or in my case, grand-mama!! Still recovering from vacay...and trying to shake the nasty cold I've managed to catch!! I've decided that I won't get rid of it until I give it away! Any volunteers? Nah . . . I thought not! Well, let's talk about my new card for this week's cool challenge at Mo's DP2 Challenge Blog, shall we? Our hostess this week, Sheila, is actually taking a bit of a break for health reasons. But, she did give us a cool "Bingo" card to use for this week's challenge . . . soooooooooooooo . . . let's play . . .
Sure there were some nice beers, most of which I had the Hood River fest, I thought the Laurelwood Fresh Nuggs really stood out and the Deschutes Fresh Hop Mirror Pond was very subpar. Overall I just want to see a fall beer festival on the size scale of Holiday Ale or Spring beer... Please?

Let’s be clear here. I genuinely do not know what they do teach at Bar school. Some law stuff and a bit of advocacy I guess. I’ve never really known much more than this and I’m not sure if it’s relevant to my day-to-day business of managing and promoting a set of chambers. If it is, well, too late …

My birth mother remembers rolling with her children down the southern slope of Mt. Baldy, and when we arrived at the base last August, she was disappointed to find access to the former trail blocked by plastic fences, forcing us to take another, more roundabout route to the top. Too many feet, too little Marram grass taking root, and the mountain she knew has begun to slip. It was hot and humid and the mosquitoes dive-bombed us as we trudged single-file up the thick sand along the new path. “Isn’t this something?” my birth father marveled from his anchor position at the end of the line. “Who would have thought? All of us together like this?”
I am a poor college student, and like many people ,I do not have a lot of money to give to the Church or to the poor. (Although I am fairly certain that I could spare 2 bucks a week) Of course, what I have an abundance of is time. I challenge anyone who is reading this, and I include myself, to give of your time to help the poor and needy. In the United States, if the 224,457,000 people that claim to be “Christians” spent one hour a week serving in their community that would be close to 11.5 billion hours of service a year. Think of all the good we could do for those who are less fortunate if we could only commit to spending 1 hour a week sacrificing our time and serving the poor. Again, this is something that I am convicted of daily. I have not done what I should in serving others, especially those who are less fortunate than myself. I have failed, as have many “Christians” in the area of helping the poor, but we can right the ship. We can start today by looking for opportunities to serve in our communities. We can give that homeless guy on the corner a few bucks to buy himself a sandwich. We can become the change that is so needed in our culture. We can change the way that the world views the Church. We can change the world for the glory of God.
Manifestations of this social engineering are the posting currency of many a blogger. The latest town hall idiocy ripped apart, mocked, wittily and inventively debunked and held up for ridicule across the libertarian echo chamber until the next one comes along as you know it surely will.
After the descent into violent conflict, there will be vast swathes of the country that have no unusual military presence at all, and that will be free zones for British paramilitaries to move, train, and organize as they deem appropriate. Only ‘normal’ police attention will be brought to bear on them. This will allow these areas to play a role similar to the one which the Republic of Ireland played for the PIRA during the Troubles, allowing them to operate with a minimum of scrutiny. Of course, the RUC could not operate at all in the Republic, and it was difficult if not impossible for the British government to have terrorist suspects extradited to the UK, two advantages that British paramilitaries will not have during the conflict in their own hinterlands. Nonetheless, they will still enjoy huge freedom of movement and action in this area, and the police will find it very difficult indeed to disrupt it. The more vicious the conflict becomes, the less willingness there will be a) on the part of local people to report suspicious events, and b) on the part of the British police to act against British paramilitaries anyway.

Enter Janetha’s May challenge:
Though nothing can replace the concept of that drink, the Lushington ($12) rye whiskey, quince gastrique, egg white, 25yr aged balsamic vinegar also caught my eye, and our server gave it his recommendation. I thought the whiskey was a little strong, so the cocktail would best consumed with or after food, not on an empty stomach.

"If you don't have anything going on this afternoon we could go sit by the pool back at the hotel or hang out in my room," I suggested.
Not to big of a problem though, I've yet to have had it fall off on it's own.
Another weakness of proxy detailing is that it shortcuts one of the things we ask literature to do, namely, to help us see the familiar in a new light. If I do indeed have a sufficient knowledge of an '85 Chrysler LeBaron to form an image of it, it is my image that is being formed, unaltered and unestranged by the author's artistic vision.
A report released yesterday by Princeton University and the Brookings Institution found that the top five chronic childhood conditions that limit typical activities are some type of developmental, behavioral or mental problem.
In the prayer we also recognize that our human failings against Love are a major impediment to the fulfillment of His Will and therefore ask for His forgiveness, in accord with our forgiveness of those who trespass against us. In doing this we clear out anything in us that would impede His Will from being accomplished.

Yesterday I traveled to Nuneaton for dayjob purposes. I got to stay in a hotel that was really a motel that was actually the original Crossroads Motel (this won't sense if you live outside the UK or are less than thirty years old).

House Bill 3174, sponsored by State Rep. Bonnie Brown, gives adult consumers the opportunity to sample up to one ounce of spirits during a scheduled tasting event. The bill passed the House on February 20 and the Senate on March 10. Once signed by the governor, it would take effect June 8.
I served these patties with some rice to my family and they loved it. Here is some creative ideas that you can utilize this dish. Instead of steaming process, you can make them into big patties like hamburger patties, coat with flour and egg, and fry them in the same way. It will take longer to cook and the color will be darker but they will make gorgeous chicken tofu burger with some lettuce & and tomatoes.

Based on pilot patient observations, and experience from the prior study KTS-1-2008, the investigators anticipate that chronic fatigue syndrome patients may benefit from B-cell depletion therapy using Rituximab induction with maintenance treatment.
One of my best purchases-- I bought this before Sarina was even 2 years old, and it's still going strong. What's so great about this train table is that it's all built in-- there are no little parts to lose. It's molded plastic, so you don't have to worry about it falling apart. It's very durable, and good for playdates for both boys and girls. You can use Thomas or other trains in it, as well.

When you decide to become a stay-at-home parent, you enter into a different realm — one ruled by illogical two-year-old dictators, school schedules, and choosing the correct color yogurt. As much as I can explain this to my husband, I don’t know that I’m getting through. Now I’ve done the next best thing: creating a list of questions that will help him and other office-bound parents gauge how (cough, cough) similar their days are to ours.

Deuteronomy 28 v 1 -7 says clearly that if you are obedient to God, you won’t have to fight he said the enemy that comes against you in one way will flee before you in seven ways. In the name that is above every other name, from now on, all the enemies that stand up against you will be smitten by the Almighty God himself.

Then we move toward the background images, where someone is looking out the doorway, where his identity has been disputed: some say it’s Lee Oswald, others that it’s Billy Lovelady; but if it’s Lee Oswald, then he can’t be on the 6th floor shooting at JFK:

Our pomelo was a lovely fellow, but a bit pricey at $3.19 each. I'm hoping that I can grab some pomelos more cheaply at the Asian markets in Albany (these citrus fruits are natives of Southeast Asia), because it really was a nice treat.
The Death Eaters and their masks were certainly one of the more sinisterly memorable features from the Potterverse, which no doubt cropped up in a few nightmares post trip to the cinema, this one giving Iron Man a run for his money.
That was 2+ years ago. I could go into great detail about the past 2 years but I won’t. I’m not going to lie and tell you that I’m “cured” and these thoughts don’t still bother me. They very much so do. There have been close calls and stupid things that relied on. The point is, I was shown hope. I was given that friend that truly and honestly has never left me by the way side. Do I deserve everything he’s done for me? Nope, not at all. In fact there have been times where I’ve told him not to bother with me anymore, there is no hope. In my case, it was very true that all I really needed was a good friend. I didn’t deserve it but I was still very thankful for it. I honestly probably wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for him. He also was able to show me hope through Jesus. It wasn’t easy and I resisted for a long time. Eventually though I realized that it was Jesus working though Joshua for me. What grace and mercy I was given!!

This is the tenth installment of the infamous diary within a used book that I found hidden among the stacks of an old defunct library. The building routinely holds events where donated books are sold off, by the grocery bag full, for just a few dollars. I’d estimate that I paid roughly seven or eight cents for this particular item. It contains the strange diary of a cat obsessed woman living in 1988. At the time of this posting, I am currently using the information inside to look for her. If people continue to become interested in her story, and I eventually locate her, I might try to contact her for an interview or to get a photo together. Until then, however, I would like to protect that author’s anonymity.

From the Pacific northwest (oregon/washington state).. through the midwest … Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Arkansas …. through the southeast … Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida….. we are seeing severe weather, strong thunderstorms, damaging winds, hail, and confirmed tornadoes on the ground (in the midwest for sure).

A few days after returning from their third trip, Jo was arrested, she suspects a neighbor informant told the authorities on them. The following day Han was arrested also, she never saw her husband Jo again. They kicked and beat Han with wooden rods and crushed part of her skull, then placed her hands on the hard concrete floor and stomped on them. Then, without further explanation she was released, she was three months pregnant.

I had a sweet elderly lady in for the usual workup. I was getting her onto the bedpan and while her daughter stayed in the room the son stepped out to let us work. She was on the pan, and making small talk - and was the funniest patient I've had in a while. She had me laughing so hard; I don't know if you've ever been in the same situation, but hysterically laughing while someone is trying to take a pee can be kind of awkward.

Two days ago, like many of my classes, I taught a lesson, and gave the students some practice questions. I have predicted that in line with the recent trend only a few would attempt them. So today, I broke my corporal punishment virginity, and decided to make it a bit eventful as well. I had the students' names in an envelope, and to randomly selected a few to solve the practice problems that I have assigned. As I announced this new lesson plan and vigorously swung around my new wand of power, saying "I know kung fu," the students began to belatedly do their homework. Surprise surprise. And when the selected students had no idea how to solve the questions, I gave them a pretty mightyful swing. In fact, two of the sticks broke, and even a small crowd was formed right outside the classroom door.
What we seem to be observing is an increasing number of full-fledged patent strategies being maintained by companies other than the original owner. This poses both a research and a pedagogical challenge. From the research perspective, it will be interesting to study the considerations that enable the acquirer to value a huge patent portfolio based primarily on the "defensive" worth of the patents, ex ante, and to evaluate whether the acquisition was worthwhile, post ante. Will we conclude that these acquisitions were a reasonable business risk or simply the patent version of the "dot.com" bubble from a decade ago? From the pedagogical point of view, these developments underscore the fact that there are now new and substantial corporate actors that must be taken into account in any consideration of patent strategy, actors whose considerations are quite different from those that presumably drive a company in its formulating and implementing a patent strategy (I am not talking about mass patent aggregators, such as Intellectual Ventures. For a superb discussion of patent aggregrators, see Tom Ewing & Robin Feldman,"The Giants Among Us" here.) Virtually no materials or even pedagogical guides exist for this. For this Kat, the challenge of considering patent strategy in these changing circumstances is "Fear and Trembling: part II."
Of course, we did other stuff besides eat. We went to Happy Hour with one of my high school friends. Had dessert with Courtney’s college roommate and her now fiancé and grabbed pizza with my college Graduate Hall Director. We went and saw “Newsies” on Broadway which was perfect. It is one of my favorite movies and the playwrights did it right. We burned up SoHo and Fifth Avenue and tried to boost the economy. We conquered the subways. We visited the 9/11 Memorial and went to the top of the Empire State Building (totally touristy, but we hadn’t done it before). We walked along the High Line in Chelsea and explored as many neighborhoods as we could. It was a perfect trip. Although it didn’t stop me from turning 30, it was the best way I can think of to celebrate a birthday.

"SHEER TERROR"? Under a bright white sky? Maybe, but a show of hands first: who can tell me what's missing in this picture? No, not a printed promise of anti-Jaws film quality. No, not the artist trying to lull people into a false sense of security by reminding them of Goldfinger. Can't get it? Look at the surface of the water. See that waving hand? Unless Lurch finally got tired of Thing's emo crap and flung him into the ocean, or the shark just took a huge chomp of 99% of this drowning victim, I'd say we have a serious physicality problem with this Roy Scheider cameo, here.

And, oh, all the renovating and decorating ideas I have dancing through my head right now! I'm already having fun with it and we haven't even moved in! One of my first plans I've decided on is to paint the wood floors in the kitchen and the great room in a checkerboard pattern (which is actually historically accurate), similar to this:
Kreisleriana opened with a movement by turns tempestuous and dreamily poetic, Florestan and Eusebius setting the scene for the work as a whole. The two ensuing intermezzi evoked a similar, continued contrast and competition, which yet retained common poetic ground. Scales were transmuted into something so much more in the third movement, whilst the fifth imparted a fine sense of a snapshot, neither begun nor completed, but rather revealed to us for a while. The opening of the final movement flickered like Schubert’s Irrlicht, though was always underpinned by absolute rhythmic security. Its passionate central section was striking for its unforced sincerity: that both of pianist and composer.

Pam wished she’d found the shears; their long sharp blades would have given her a much longer reach through the tangled growth. The secateurs would have been great for those thick trunk-like stems at the bottom; cutting through them would ensure the ivy didn’t grow back. Instead, she pulled and pulled, grabbing at handfuls of leaves, throwing them over her shoulder towards the wheelbarrow. As the light slowly began to penetrate through the green gloom, she saw something glinting on the ground just ahead, something long and metallic.

Anyway, enough about me and my new beloved.
So now you need to sew (by hand or with the machine). Just lay out a braid, then on top of it the solid piece, then a braid. I started with the braids that had the un-cut ends (numbers 4 and 6 above) since I figured they'd be easier to sew and I was trying to manage my jersey-rage. Just lay the three pieces stacked together on the sewing machine and stitch away! It doesn't have to be pretty because you won't see it in the finished product.

I have read several books on the cosmetics industry and the first shocking bit of information I had known little about was that many companies we buy our make up, facial cleansing and moisturizing products, body products, etc from actually produce two different formulas - the product they sell here in the United States and the product (a much safer product) in European countries. The European Union came up with a Cosmetics Directive which they have banned 1000+ chemicals that are not allowed in products sold in European countries...the United States - 11. There are many wonderful people and organizations working on getting the Safe Cosmetics Act passed here in the United States that would hopefully get our number up a little higher.

Also why does it tell me that I could be getting more fiber even though I already get tons? “Eat more grains”. Um…I eat some form of high fiber grains at each meal – unless I’m calculating the serving sizes wrong it just wants me to eat bigger portions? Basically I eat brown rice or occasionally brown pasta with lunch and dinner, and sometimes some sort of sandwich with whole grain bread as a snack. Plus a small portion of whatever I had for dinner the night before as breakfast (I don’t like most Western breakfast foods, other than oatmeal).I’m confused – how in the hell could I be getting MORE grains? Also why doesn’t it let you indicate that you’re consuming whole grains rather than the processed white versions? Makes a big difference nutritionally, that.

So - after finding all this fabulous inspiration what did I do? I took the lazy route. I found this cute heart bucket made from rusty metal, wire and nails on half price at a local boutique. The price was right. The effort was perfect (drop from a red ribbon on the door). It even has a little pocket in the top for Valentine's (hint hint to any peeps who want to make my day).

I gave this book five stars.
While everyone else is out chasing pumpkins and apples, I have been quietly collecting vegetables of the seasons gone by, the local leftover lima beans, corn, and zucchini, the former two, critical to the largely ignored autumnal toss of boiled corn and beans known as succotash. Most references to succotash hail from the Warner Brother's very dimwitted, yet endearing, sputtering cat, Slyvester, but its true and honest provenance is the American Indian Narragansett word for boiled corn, msíckquatash.

The seller I bought the lot of vintage catchers from posted a lot of 1951 Bowman cards. It was a decent sized lot and I commented that I'd be interested in the catchers if he didn't get a buyer for the whole lot. He contacted me and offered me 5 of the Bowman cards plus all the other catcher cards you've seen here the last few days. Here are the very first 1951 Bowman cards I've ever touched, much less owned.
But if I had any true guidance to give you, it would be to say, “Get ready, and open, and receive.” This is our gift of partnership. To you.
The inspiration for the tag is from Tim's 12 Tags of Christmas 2009, Day 3. I opted for spring colors to give the piece a lighter feel. After all, spring starts Tuesday! The recycled packaging from some of the dies was cut with a butterfly die then colored with the alcohol inks and attached to the bow with the tiny stapler. I know it's hard to see but it's there and it's wings were folded so it's 3-D.
As the line of storms hit our area, it rained cats and dogs, but not long. Even well before colonial times, superstitious persons believed cats symbolized the rain and dogs the wind; thus, the saying.
Aelfric will laugh at him, then tell the story of how he killed Caedwalla's father, incinerated him, then added him to his Sack of Ashes. A leather bag is hug from the ridge-pole of his dining hall. He always incinerates his enemies, he says, as it prevents them haunting him. With a critical Awareness check, characters can see something inside the bag wriggling. Caedwalla is incensed, but makes his Hospitality vs. Love (Family) check and so keeps his peace. His host asks the characters to leave in the morning, saying that he will give them a day's start.
Finally, you scare me because if you serve a second term I will probably not feel safe in writing a similar letter in 8 years.
To me, it sounds like the opening lines of a phone sex conversation. But let’s face it, for many of us Jews, the stomach is our sensual organ of choice. And for those of us of Eastern European extraction, the Ashkenazim, the deli is the cultural center of our sensual universe, much like the synagogue or the temple is our soul.
Several times a year I'm completely consumed by a book this way. Nothing exists but me, the characters and their world. And when I read the last page and close the cover, it's as if I'm leaving a lover after a secret weekend in a hotel room. There has been very little sleeping. Scenes linger in my thoughts for weeks. And I wish I could go back and experience it anew.
Personally I really like room sprays... because I hate it when eg the smell of food lingers when you're not hungry. Also, if I'm expecting somebody, I like to make sure my home smells nice - they should notice as soon as they walk in.

In everyday English usage, epic means “beyond the ordinary in size, extent, and scope”.
So how do we save ourselves and our culture from the Jesus of our own making? Nichols suggests that we need to get back to the tradition of the creeds and the tradition of Scripture. We need the creeds because they have helped to solidify the teaching of Scripture pertaining to, of many things, the deity of Christ. While creedal tradition can help we must ultimately rest our understanding of Christ on Scripture. When we rest on Scripture we cannot help but conclude that Jesus is God.
(Get used to me saying redundant things like that, because I love it.)

Parenthood also includes seeing your kids off at the AFEES as they take the oath on enlisting because job opportunities were stretched thinner than a Crêpes Suzette thanks to scumbags like your husband. Parenthood also includes crying inside and out knowing that your teenage child will get sent into a war zone needlessly created by your husband's party despite the recruiter's assurances they wouldn't. Parenthood for over 5000 families also includes receiving a flag folded into a tight little triangle by an honor guard at graveside. But you and your kids wouldn't know anything about that.

"It has been observed and the testimony is there from several women that have been abused by their husbands both verbally and physically. Many have testified and it seems commonplace for many husbands to take in younger women and commit adultery with them even in the presence of their wives. They also talk down to them and say, “they are not pretty any more," they physically abuse them and the multiple bruises display the evidence. What is worse is law enforcement looks the other way and allows this moral evil to take place daily.

Ben shows up and Harry has an awesome lisp that made me want to drink with him, until he offered Ben Chardonnay, which is the bastard child of the wine world. Ben was like shit. Then it got worse, because he realized he was drinking wine out of kitschy wine glasses made out of mason jars. For a winemaker, this had to be like getting your prostate examined by a guy you aren’t sure is a doctor. I mean, you go to a nice restaurant and the waiter literally wraps a fucking napkin around the wine because it’s hard enough to pour it, let alone drinking it from a mason jar like you are running from lawmen in the 1800s. If I had a helicopter, I’d have come down and saved Ben in a bro kind of way.
I knew a person once we said to me "I know that if someone wanted to harm me, I could not protect my self or my children and I am fine with that." "If it is my time to go, it is my time to go." Of course she said that, but she didn't really believe it, otherwise she wouldn't take her child to the doctor or wear her seat belt or turn on the alarm in her house, but it's what she tells herself because thinking about being mugged, raped or murdered is scary. Thinking about your children being harmed is unimaginable and it is easier not to, until of course you have no other choice. Often what appears to be easy, turns out to be the hardest thing of all. I understand that mindset. I was pretty much the poster child for that mindset. When I get a comment like I did yesterday from anonymous I am not angry with him or her because I was him or her. I told someone last night that this person who keeps posting anonymously, it feels personal to me. I keep thinking it is someone who knows me. Someone who is close to me, but maybe it is just that I can so intimately identify with the thinking that I feel a connection to him or her. I don't know.

Sequels. They're the bane of any movie lover's existence. Sure, every once in a while you get a good one like Terminator 2 or the Back to the Future sequels, but a lot of the time they're just made to cash in on the original's success and are not made with the same kind of strokes of brilliance that the original film was. Then sometimes another one is made. Then another. Then another. Then another, all until the series is sucked dry and left to die like a festering corpse in the desert. What a horrible chain of events. And what better to epitomize this raping of creativity and artistic vision than by looking at the complete lack of anything salvageable that is Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.

Firstly, for quite a population in our country, female children are considered a liability. A vexatious object, a beautiful creation, which is to be loathed. The funny part being, not only is the hatred parted by masculine side of the family; but the feminine half exchanges the un-pleasantries never the less. Believe me, please do; I write this not on witnessing some melodramatic idiot-box crap; but my own discretion of events witnessed first-hand. I was 13 years old then, but had a fair sense of rage on the plight of my then female colleagues. The delivery ward, the families, some overjoyed, some worried. Worried about the third girl child delivered, the anguish of broken expectations of having a male child starkly written on their faces, the fear of the third marriage that they will have to conduct; the misery I expected that mother to go through in the days to come…

As the bus roared into action and the doors closed, I stood beside the headteacher, a man with a beautiful mind. He smiled at his pupils, willing them to have a good time. "She'll be fine," he said, his eyes fixed on the smiling faces that now greeted us. I nodded. "I'll see you on Friday," I said. How could I ever live without that child? She reminds me every day how rich and complete my life really is.

One thing we hear over and over again in special education is that for kids with special needs direct instruction works best. Direct instruction is where the teacher explicitly teaches and students watch as she takes them through a lesson. As opposed to exploratory learning, where a concept is introduced and the students do a lot of self-teaching, through group activities, trial and error, etc. I even had a special ed professor who said this latter type of teaching was the "hippie way." you may as well sit around smoking something and talking about your feelings with the students Ah, I loved that professor...
The world doesn't stand in dire need of another online story outlet. (But another one certainly can't hurt, either.)

In actual practice, the most commonly used species concept is the morphological species concept. Quite simply, species are organisms that we can differentiate based on visible anatomical or morphological features.
I have unspecific recollections that other people I've listened to have said this before, but ... for purely commercial cinema, 2010's Morning Glory is shockingly decent. Not "subversive"; nothing "smuggled": it's simply a product with narrative content that is honest and expressive in contrast to most Hollywood releases: there's a faint trace of 1930s-40s classical Hollywood in this movie. (Perhaps it's because it depicts a world of busy invention and constant improvisation, not unlike the production plants of classical Hollywood themselves.) Rachel McAdams plays a 28-year-old morning show producer, Becky Fuller, who loses her job in New Jersey. She gets a shot at a low-rated morning show in New York at the station IBS. There, she is soon expected to raise flagging ratings considerably if she wants to keep her job and to keep the show on air.
Some things are meant to be done in secret so that only the Lord, who knows the heart, will see why we have done them. Other things are meant to be shared with all who will listen so that they will know Him, too. But all things are a matter of the heart and to whom it belongs.

This is the heart of the calendar system. It combines two cycles of sacred numbers: one of 13 days, one of 20. The dates on the tzolkin are a combination of the numbers 1-13 and one of twenty archetypal glyphs. It begins with 1 Imix (that’s July 17th 2012), then 2 Ik, 3 Akbal, 4 Kan, and so on, cycling through all 13 numbers and 20 glyphs ending on 13 Ahau.

Again to my additional surprise, both girls began to own their own heinous behavior and they actually grasped the concepts we were trying to share with them (albeit, my niece tried valiantly to deflect as much responsibility as possible, her friend would not let her get away with it) and while I don't think either girl will abandon their myspace, facebook and formspring pages, nor their phones, I feel that they were given food for thought.
The swiss roll cake was really fantastic. Of course mine looked less than perfect, but the taste was phenomenal. Light and moist with the perfect amount of sweetness. I made two flavors of ice cream: vanilla bean and french vanilla (sorry, forgot which recipes I used), and added a layer of chocolate ganache. I made a mini bombe and a deconstructed version. Personally, I liked the deconstructed version better. But that's just me sometimes: disorganized and random (sshh...don't tell my students).
And I will always remember that day. It was a treasure.

So my evening, from about 4:30 till 6 has been revision. Of everything in one subject. Yawn. And then I did another 40 minutes – 1 hour of more revision, of another subject. I haven’t stopped, all evening. I had a break at 6 though, to watch The Simpsons. It was a rubbish episode.
The White House is scrambling to get some distance from her comments, not even waiting until morning to chastise her. The bus she went under was chock full of top administration officials, including the President and First Lady personally. Good for them.

One of the funnier moments was the 'Weekend Update' segment with Seth Meyers. The satirical news desk show poked fun at Donald Trump and his Celebrity Apprentice show.
That's when I started looking to Kate in admiration. Sure, she flipped out on Jon... A LOT! But, seriously, how many moms reading this have never gone off on their husband and looked back later and thought, "Ewww, I didn't like what that felt like!" Well, guess what, if you are on a reality show... you get to add one more dimension to that, you get to say, "Ewww, I didn't like what that LOOKED like!"
Admittedly, it’s not like they’ve got a wealth of opportunities to draw from.
Then we got up, and went to Denny’s to have our free Grand Slam. MMMMMMMMMMMMM yummy! Then it was catching up on the DVR (watched Chuck in 3D, but was disappointed in the lack of 3D) and taking naps….I need more days like this.
In this case Larry (I think he was named Larry) was looking kind of pathetic, wearing himself out trying to run up the sink and getting nowhere. I felt bad for him. Surely he didn’t get this big by being stupid and this is how things would end? It didn’t seem right. And then he did the cutest thing: he stopped climbing and walked over to a water drop and starting drinking. Seriously. Like a fucking puppy. Adorable.
Besides, unless they're randomly sending out dozens of initial inquiries, there must be something they saw, read, heard, or learned about my services that attracted them enough to take the time to contact me.
As it is a *list* show, we each threw down 10 titles, even though we could’ve easily come up with more. One we forget is pure art director porn called Ashes and Snow, narrated by Laurence ‘Don’t ever call him Larry’ Fishburne. Some say there’s no there, there. Others say it’s jaw-droppingly damn well worth it. Well, that’s why this stuff is subjective. (We include the links for all of them below as well as some we referenced in passing.)
"The Pakistani suppliers have had a good reputation among global sports firms ever since child labor was officially banned here. Children as young as 10 years old used to stitch footballs until there was an international outcry about it. The sports companies, accustomed to nurturing their image with huge sums of money, got worried about their reputation. So they sided with human rights campaigners and exerted pressure. In 1997, Pakistani suppliers and representatives of Unicef and the International Labor Organization signed the Atlanta Agreement in which the industry agreed to stop the use of child labor.
When I’m not depressed I’ll often try to correct false ideas about depression, but when I am depressed, I’m too fucking tired. Most people don’t have the imagination to visualize what it is like, so I go to great lengths to hide it. You know what’s more depressing that being depressed? Being depressed and heckled by fools at the same time.

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!
Sabah BN has also been pushing for a royal commission of inquiry (RCI) into the illegal immigrant problem there for months now, with Cabinet ministers saying such an inquiry “will have little value” if announced after elections and that the issue puts their “political lives on the chopping block”.

The Baby Trap – Janine Wood
In 1679, Danckaerts and his colleague Peter Sluyter came to New York in search of land. For 200 years Danckaerts’ meticulously written and illustrated diaries lay undiscovered until Henry C. Murphy, a founder of the Long Island Historical Society, (later renamed the Brooklyn Historical Society) came upon the diaries in 1864 in an Amsterdam book store. Now an important part of the BHS collection and an invaluable primary resource for scholars, the diaries will be featured in this exhibit in celebration of the 400 Years of the Dutch in New York.

I can’t remember when exactly I decided to propose to her, but I know I’d been thinking of it for a while. My biggest hang-up was not having a ring. Of course I wanted to do it right and have a nice shiny ring to give her, but those things are pricey! Finally I’d saved up enough and decided that the moment had arrived. But first I had to decide which shiny pretty thing to get her. That’s where a couple of her friends come in. I enlisted them as my secret agents to help me pick out her newest piece of jewelry. After a few dozen emails back and forth the decision was made!
In the U.S., the government has approved GMOs based on studies conducted by the same corporations that created them and profit from their sale. Increasingly, Americans are taking matters into their own hands and choosing to opt out of the GMO experiment.

I'm short. Only 65 items, but I'm short. sigh..... So I spent the obligatory 5 minutes thinking about what I could have done differently, about the sales I didn't make, the items I didn't list and then I stopped.

A couple of days ago, I shared Greg Kulowiec’s great post on the Why of iPads. Many districts are jumping on the mobile learning bandwagon without really giving it a lot of thought. Greg provides a nice foundation for anyone who’s thinking about implementing iPads as part of learning.
“We do not hold seminars or have speakers, we have each other. The widows come together to enjoy life the way they did when their spouse was still alive. From surfing to zip-lining, we are here to enjoy each others company and share some of our fondest memories.”
A few months before I was born, back in the early 1960s, my Dad met a stranger who was new to our small town. From the beginning, Dad was fascinated with this enchanting newcomer, and soon invited him to live with our family. The stranger was quickly accepted and was around to welcome me into the world a few months later. As I grew up, I never questioned his place in our family. Mum taught me to love the Word of God, and Dad taught me to obey it. But the stranger was our storyteller.
The rising price of cost of goods sold can be explained by the augmenting cost of commodity prices world-wide. However, as demonstrated in the graph below, Coca-Cola stock is riding a positive trend. Investors still have faith that the company will still generate enough of a profit, particularly the economy showing distinct signs of life (the Dow hit a 4-year high today), bolstered by strong manufacturing and consumer reports, to account for the rising price of sugar.
This did not change my husband's mind about needing to mix things up so I could be properly "reassured" during maintenance. He didn't tell me what he had planned for Sunday night but simply that he was thinking and had some ideas. Said it with a lopsided grin on his face too. I'd look worried and he'd pop over and give me a kiss and squeeze. The terrible grin never faded.
Now for the CR84FN Challenge details:
It was clear to me from this observation that no matter how implicitly I trusted Kev's abilities to head a football, I would require his services as an explorer no more than I would need Fielder's as a navigator. I suggested dropping Fielder off in the Durley countryside to make his own way home, much like Richard Branson's parents did to their eight year old son; but not wanting manslaughter on my conscience, I resisted.

Yes, you say, all dogs fart. Yes they do but do they wake you in the middle of the night with their silent stench? Oh, yes...they are the silent but deadly type. You never have time to prepare. It can happen anywhere and at anytime. Is it associated with an urgent need to use the facilities (grass, bushes, etc)? No, he will let one fly foul just after he's been ...um...out. Is it when he is scared? Sure it has happened but is not narrowed down to a stressful squirt.

Saute the scallions and onions in the olive oil until softened. Add the tomatoes and liquid from the can and cook for a few minutes, smashing the tomatoes a bit with a fork. Add the white wine, the cannellini beans, salt, pepper and shredded fresh basil. Simmer for about five minutes, then add the fish. Put a lid on the skillet, then let everything cook together for about five more minutes. That will be long enough to cook the fish. Garnish with more fresh basil and serve.
Many television news programs asked the question is it time for America to have an honest talk about race. I saw it on many of the programs on MSNBC including Morning Joe, Up with Chris Hayes, Now featuring Alex Wagner, Political Nation with Al Sharpton, and quite a few others. Many people were talking about whether or not the shooting of Trayvon was an opportunity to talk about race. But few of these shows took the opportunity to actually talk about race.

The origin Eros is most commonly known for, however, is being the son of Aphrodite (Greek Goddess of beauty, love, and desire) and Ares (Greek God of war and blood lust)... yeah, try figuring that one out... (all girls like a bad boy, I guess) His image as this particular Eros... more personified... less conceptual, is one he shares with his Roman counterpart, Cupid; equipped with wings, a bow, and arrows that can make anyone fall in love... including himself (see Eros and Psyche and #5 below)

Born December 15, 1983 , Sean Quinlan started his career as a conditional rider with Edward O’Grady in Co Tipperary before crossing the Irish Sea to try his luck attached to Richard Phillips at Adlestrop. Arrived in Gloucestershire in August, 2005, and after a total of nine winners in his first two seasons recorded his best-ever total of 25 last season. His first winner in Britain was Phillips-trained Caesarean Hunter at Exeter in December, 2005, and his biggest was Chaninbar for Milton Harris in the Alder Hey Imagine Appeal Red Rum Handicap Chase, a Grade Three two-miler, at the Grand National meeting two years ago. Over the past five seasons Midnight Haze’s trainer Kim Bailey, based near Andoversford, has supplied most of his winners. John Smith’s Grand National record: no previous rides

I could post photo's all night but I won't! :) Some of these photo's were taken by other team members... I was too busy to take pics!

Corporations, run by contracts, have reason to run lean and mean. Profit is the bottom line, and profit does not lend itself to love of God and others being the first rule of behavior. But the church should not be lean and mean, it should be deep and wide, where it reflects compassion, kindness, sacrificial love, nurture to growth, and holds itself together by the divine and human acts of forgiveness and reconciliation.

When I read Dubliners. I suppose I was about 19. While I’d been writing bad poems, the odd juvenile short story, and the like; it had never really occurred to me before then as an actual possibility. But, the language of that book, coupled with my enormous naiveté, made me believe it was something I could do.
Tuesday morning found us moving slowly. Our wine and cheese party lasted until 3:30am and we loved every minute. About 12 friends came, many who had never met each other before but you would never have known it! Much laughter and more than a little wine! Peter joined us and we struck out for Passy cemetery near la Tour Eiffel. A beautiful small cemetery with many photo ops. The sun came out and made it more so. A quick trip to Trocadero and the obligatory shots of us and la Tour followed. We walked a few blocks and had lunch and a quick trip through the Yves St. Laurent Foundation exhibit by David Hockney. He has created art by using his touch screen on iPads and iPhones. Amazing. Mary left us about 3 and headed to Montmartre to meet a friend and Peter and I zipped off to the Marais. I did some shopping and we took some photos along the way. At 5 we met photographer Carla Coulson and Jean-Luc Rollier at a nearby cafe. We had a wonderful time getting to know each other and of course talking photography! At 7:30 we met CDP blogger Laurent ( Daily Photo in Paris) and Mary for a nice dinner and a little champagne. Merci Peter. We ended another grand day in Paris at the Hotel de Ville metro. Today we leave our fabulous apt. for a hotel for our last day in Paris. Our flight to Cininnati is looking good. My flight to Bham is iffy. C'est la vie.

Every once in a while a film comes along that clearly has ulterior motives, be it a political message or double meanings or, as in this case, to product place and make money. Battleship is a culmination of Hasbro emptying their pockets to repeat Transformers’ success and the studio going through its bargain bin of rejected plot lines mashing something together. Some effort has been put into ensuring that it’s a Box Office hit, but that doesn’t stop the result from being anything short of laughable.

The selling of worthless “indulgences” as a means to wipe one’s sins clean was the final straw.
And, I found couple new blogs to follow today. One I found through Pat Sloan's blog, Ali Edwards, One Little Word. It is talking about choosing a word for the next year that speaks to you - any word that just comes to you and makes you feel something. Pat talks about words she has chosen (Ali has been doing this for a few years now) and I think it is a neat idea. No, I have not picked a word - but I am going to.....
I've watched DVDs, slept, felt sorry for myself, attempted a jigsaw and got cross with myself trying to put the sky together because it was just 100 pieces of blue and frankly I don't have the patience for that. I've groaned and sniffed and gargled and nearly fallen asleep in the bath. I've been very poor company for the brilliant friend that came round and spent a whole day with me, patiently shouting out crossword clues as I lay half dozing in bed, making my tea and waiting for about an hour while I painfully tried to swallow it, and listening to me moan. I don't do suffering quietly or well, and my tonsils have I'm sure been the most infected tonsils ever to grace the back of anyone's throat.

So anyway, we made it through our third level of hell with me passing off a pink folder for purple and two black composition books for marbled (I had reached my limit of patience, marbled composition books do not exist in my realm of reality and any teacher who requests purple as one of the colors for a folder is just asking for trouble) and we piled ourselves into a checkout line. Thankfully the checkout was a quick one, which was something short of a miracle, and we ventured back outside where it was still raining.
Next we need to know the split of the loans between residential and commercial. That split at present is 20:80 and the reasons for that are set out above. Next we need know the performance of the residential and commercial markets in Ireland and the UK since last November 2009. The performance is measured by reference to indices that NAMA itself judges reliable enough to include them as acceptable references for loan valuations in the LEV Regulation. So for Ireland we use the Permanent TSB/ESRI Index for residential, the Jones Lang Lasalle index for commercial (unfortunately both are quarterly – there are no monthly indices in Ireland) and for the UK we use the Nationwide Building Society index for residential and the IPD index for commercial (both are monthly). By applying the split between residential and commercial and the performance of both in the two markets since November 2009 we can calculate what the CMV should be today.
So it’s pretty amazing how when you get older the fear of doing things you use to do when you were younger creep up on you. Ronald and I just bought ourselves some new bikes recently and in my head, I was thinking “Oh… this is going to be a piece of cake.” In a way, I was wrong. That old saying, once you ride a bike you never forget is true. It’s the fear of taking a turn that got me to hit the brakes and panic a little.

Lastly, we want to make note in the difference of natural evil versus moral evil. David Platt preaches on natural and moral evil and says the following. “Moral evil primarily includes sin. Moral evil is wickedness, inequity, transgression, sin. It’s the evil that we believe, the evil that we do. Satan draws us into, tempts us to sin. Moral evil includes sin. But that’s not the only picture of evil that we see. We also see in all the Scripture and in the Gospels natural evil, which primarily includes suffering. This is not necessarily stuff that we do, but stuff that may happen to us; maybe natural disasters, sickness that is brought on. It’s different. It’s evil, but it’s not moral evil in the same way sin is. It’s different. Natural evil includes suffering.” “Now obviously they are connected; moral evil is ultimately the cause of natural evil. It goes all the way back to the beginning; we have catastrophic things that happen, natural disasters, tornadoes, hurricanes, as a result of sin’s entrance into the world in Genesis 3.”

If the idiots in the theatre trample each other in a mad rush from a fire that doesn’t even exist, it was their own stupidity and lack of clearheadedness that killed them, not the person shouting fire. If your reaction to the mere threat of danger is to hurt others, you are the culprit.

I responded with an extremely humble apology in both an e-mail and a phone call and offered to pay a portion of the cost. I said that I would never knowingly steal someone else's property and that I am so very sorry.
It is for you to find your place in the history of humanity. Nobody can do it for you. It is a work that will be left undone unless you do it yourself. The world doesn't need another Mother Teresa. The Church doesn't need another Francis of Assisi. The world needs you. The Church needs you. Mother Teresa had a role to play in God's plan, and she played it. Francis had a mission to fulfill in God's plan, and he fulfilled it. Now it falls to you to find your role, your place.

But knowledge, talent, allegiance, and a dose of mystic wisdom are not ALL that this man has to offer. Although he now resides in Korea, Steven spent most of his life in Alabama, and resultingly possesses a large library of underground music from that particular region -- "Southern punk rock and metal that doesn't sound like Alabama Thunderpussy", as he himself so eloquently put it. While he has repeatedly refused my offers of full-time work here at IC, today we are lucky enough to have Steven by for a quick post, at least, showcasing the highlights of said library. Dig in.

There are mountain views, valley views, original pioneer cabins and outbuildings (not reproductions), waterfalls, roaring rivers, calm ponds, and a host of wildlife. I photographed a bear that was visible from the car! The possibilities really seem endless.

Even when she was little, Casey—a.k.a. Praying Mantis—knew she was going to be an entomologist. And what about Jess? Casey told her to run, so she became a runner, and Casey dubbed her “Dragonfly.” They were best friends forever. But now Casey has been arrested for murder. Of course it’s a mistake. Stephanie Grass was the brattiest kid at camp; Casey and Jess weren’t the only counselors who complained about her. Sure, Casey used to joke aboust killing the kid, but she wasn’t serious.While the whole town takes sides and waits for the trial, Jess finds herself the center of attention. Everyone wants to know what happened that summer. They are hanging on every word. But does anyone really care about Jess? Mostly she finds it hard to sit still; late at night she rides her bike aimlessly up and down the town’s streets. The truth is, without Casey, Jess feels left behind. And she doesn’t like it one bit.

I quite liked The Night She Disappeared. It was nothing original, just a decent thriller with good writing. I didn't think it was particularly special, but I did enjoy reading it. It was one of those books that was more about the plot than about the characters.

I worked with a doctor named Nitesh. A medical student in Florida who will soon be starting his residency in Alabama, Dr. Nitesh is a nice guy who generously made a point of giving cookies to the Peruvian kids who came to see us. Despite this kindness, he did not seem to mind that the English-Spanish language barrier meant I was the one who had to express sympathy and support to the patients who were having the most difficulty in their lives. If we had been in Lethal Weapon, Nitesh definitely would have been the hard-nosed Danny Glover character.
It is clear in “The Departed” that Costello, although he is a mob boss, acts as a father figure to both characters, as well as Queenan is to Costigan. However, it is evident that Costello’s aims and desires for both characters only benefit his organization while Queenan has a right-mind to not only put Costello into prison, but also to protect Costigan. Police corruption is perhaps the main theme of the screenplay, and coincides well with the concept of identity. Both Costigan and Sullivan must maintain their false identities, but must also make sure it does not get to them. Not only is this picture a wonderful thriller full of action, it also reflects on the idea of police corruption, a father-son relationship, and the idea of identity.

The characters are all very well drawn and the first book (of the three making up the novel) describes an unusual coming-of-age story. The sex scenes are particularly well done. The plot then takes unusual and unexpected directions and the ending is moving and satisfying, leaving the reader with a sense of hope.

I just seems like it keeps getting worse. Once returning from home, I also found out that a game I play online called World of Warcraft got hacked into. I lost a lot of items in the game and it's not important to me. It's a game. BUT it does make me concerned about if I have a virus or a key-logger on my computer and if it can pose a threat to my financial accounts that I do online. So I had to promptly cancel credit cards as a precaution and money is so tight, it's not even funny. I am also concerned about all the photos that I have online of my Mom, taken in this last year. I lost my saved phone messages from Mom about three weeks ago, and it broke me down in tears. I don't want to lose anything else, especially if it's in regards to my mom/parents. Then to add salt to all these wounds, is the fact of how my MIL left her will, and it's left my husband feeling hurt, confused and wondering if his own mother even cared about him.
Looking at stackoverflow.com data for the last week we get a picture which is very different from the Tiobe index. The first thing that stands out is that Java, C#, Javascript and PHP feature much higher in the rankings than C. This should not be surprising. While C is suited to many tasks such as operating systems and device driver development the vast majority of code being churned out by Joe Developer is not written in C.

As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.

Waveriders I give you Beehoover; the righteous, mighty, and inventive two piece ensemble from Germany that is out to send your musical enjoyment scale into tilt territory. Analyzing my own listening history, it was a forgone conclusion that I would embrace this band with wide open arms. Honestly, I feel as if a focus group looked into my brain, checked off the musical elements necessary to excite me, and compiled several of them to produce Beehoover. Let’s break it down as simply as possible, shall we? Beehoover sounds like an aggressive version of Tool, with a splash of Primus, topped off with Clutch-like vocals. Don’t worry. I’ll wait for that last sentence to properly sink in before continuing. No…I completely understand. Trust me. I feel exactly the same way!
In the end, I became something of a grouch, as my girls heard me playing my LPs and decided to dance along while I warned them not to get too vigorous too close to the turntable as it might scratch the discs. I might as well have been playing them Pink Floyd, and soon decided it was taking far too long anyway. Besides, when you took into consideration the hours wasted in this venture, it often proved easier to track down the LPs in CD format via the internet or trawls through charity and record shops.

Well, the time has already come to attack another Rollin film. Granted this one isn’t actually credited to Rollin. It’s credited to some kind of Rollin-Laserna hybrid called J.A. Laser. Anyways, “Le Lac des Mort Vivants” a.k.a. “Zombie Lake” is supposedly the worst of the Aquatic Nazi Zombie movies (yes, it is actually a recognized sub-genre), but we’re here to find out if there is any truth to that claim. It’s a pretty dismal playing field from what we’ve seen, so being the worst would be quite an accomplishment. Let’s do this. At least we won’t need subtitles because of our aforementioned French speaking capabilities. Oh yeah, this was produced in 1981…

One life-history trait is the age of first reproduction (AFR). Because AFR is highly heritable, there may have been co-evolution between biology and culture. In other words, natural selection has tended to bring full reproductive maturity into line with the age when young couples have enough resources to marry and start a family.

I started scouting about a week before my season started. Around here, there are a lot of birds in agricultural fields that border woods. I work on public lands, though, so I wanted to hunt in one of the areas where we’ve worked to improve turkey habitat. It’s a prettier spot, but also more challenging because they don’t necessarily follow the rigid patterns that develop in farmlands where they have consistent food sources and less danger from predators.

Good Morning Blogiverse! I hope you all had a lovely Valentine's Day. I did, I got to see a friend, it was a beautiful 70 degrees out here, and I got a ton of errands done which was great! I made my guy a cheesey home made Valentine that mentioned zombies on the inside and got him a small gift then made him fried chicken for dinner. I think I'm slowly learning how to be southern. He has been telling me for weeks he wasn't going to get me anything for Valentine's Day... and he was true to his word. I think he realized the mistake in that when he got home. I wasn't mad, just a little sad. Would have thought he would have wanted to make this Valentine's Day special because its our first year as a married couple (yes we're married, but the wedding isn't for a few more days.) Alas, he did not. Of course I've also magically gained back a pound in one day that it took me 3 days to lose, and I have no idea how so maybe its good he didn't buy me a bag of my favorite Sweet Tart Hearts or that box of Russell Stover Assorted Chocolates I pointed out to him and said 'I want that for Valentine's Day'. And yes, my darling came home and said 'I didn't know anything you wanted!' Oh well. I still love him dearly.

Years ago when women learned that their babies would not live long after birth, they were strongly encouraged not to bond with the baby. If you weren’t attached to something, you wouldn’t have to waste time grieving over it, and you could just get back to life after all was said and done. I’m not sure how someone could possibly have imagined that this was a good idea nor can I imagine being forced to deal with the loss of an infant in such a way.

Relationships, too, can be forever evolving and surprising in their invitations. Things may shift rather dramatically, for example, when children become their parents’ caregivers. When my mother came to live with us some years ago, we all had to make adjustments in our hopes and behaviors very quickly and unexpectedly. We thought she would soon be moving into her own nearby condominium, but her health declined rapidly, and everything suddenly changed.
Because this way of life—devouring, degrading, and insane—cannot continue. For “sustainable” to mean anything, we must embrace and then defend the bare truth: the planet is primary. The life–producing work of a million species are literally the earth, air, and water that we depend on. No human activity—not the vacuous, not the sublime—is worth more than that matrix. Neither, in the end, is any human life. If we use the word “sustainable” and don’t mean that, then we are liars of the worst sort: the kind who let atrocities happen while we stand by and do nothing.

With the latest release from Nationwide, UK house prices have now risen 0.3% since 30th November, 2009, the date chosen by NAMA pursuant to the section 73 of the NAMA Act by reference to which Current Market Values of assets are valued. The NWL Index is now at 826 (21.1%) – because only an estimated 20% of NAMA property in the UK is residential and only 29% of NAMA’s property overall is in the UK, small changes in UK residential have a negligible impact on the index – meaning that average prices of NAMA property must increase by a weighted average of 21.1% for NAMA to breakeven on a gross basis.

After the nailbiting, foot stomping, table drumming game that ended 3:1 Argentina, we stepped out onto the wet streets covered in confetti to the tunes of a million different cars all honking to the same tune! When I emerged from my Subte stop on Juramento and Cabildo I was utterly enveloped by this enormous crowd who'd literally run out into the middle of this busy intersection and stopped all traffic to celebrate. Jumping and drumming and dancing and clapping and waving flags! Viejos and chiquitos alike, everyone singing the same fight songs, and shouting the same chants, all with accompanying dance moves and hand gestures! The police even showed up, but instead of breaking up the fun and dispelling the hoards of revellers, they simply diverted the traffic so it could continue! And this was already hours after the game had ended! I haven't checked but I'm pretty sure they're still there!

Loftin has created a story with well-defined characters that have quirky characteristics. Children who fit into the middle-grade age group are just beginning to come into their own and tend to butt heads with authority a bit, so they will likely empathize with Lorelei’s problems with the adults in her life. In Splendid, most of the adults are evil or just can’t help her. Her teacher, Ms. Morrigan, and the new music teacher definitely have mean streaks. Lorelei’s new stepmother, Molly, is having a difficult time balancing the responsibilities of being a mom with what she wants. Loftin sets her up so that I was constantly wondering if she is eviler than she seems. And, even Lorelei’ dad is unable to help her. Still recovering from the death of his wife and trying to help Molly and the children come to terms with one another, Dad is having trouble coping with less-immediate-but-still-important problems in their lives, like Lorelei’s writing issues or her problems with her teachers. He has a tendency to be dismissive of his daughter’s concerns, not out of a lack of concern but just out of an inability to deal.

It is possible that (some) hanging bowls were specifically acquired for use in a funerary context and may not have had a use in ‘life’ at all. The cremation burials in Mounds 4, 5, 6 and 18 at Sutton Hoo were associated with fragments of copper-alloy bowls (Carver 1998), and a cremation burial in a hanging bowl was found at the nearby Tranmer House cemetery when the visitor centre was built (Sutton Hoo Society; Pollington 2003). The Tranmer House cemetery is tentatively dated at a little earlier than the mound cemetery at Sutton Hoo (Sutton Hoo Society), and weak stratigraphic evidence suggests that the cremation burials in mounds 5 and 6 may pre-date the ship burials (Carver 1998). If bronze bowls in general and/or hanging bowls in particular were already established as suitable containers for cremation burials, perhaps as a high-status alternative to the classic pottery funeral urn, they may have continued to be regarded as suitable grave goods when inhumation burials came into fashion.

Rob Kardashian- started with a lacklustre waltz. It was slow and pretty, but I think by the end he lacked the focus to keep his carriage and lines in full form. The judges though, were not so harsh giving him all 9′s to start with. His Freestyle was a real tribute to Cheryl Burkes genius. It started off graceful, and ended with booty shaking and energy. It was definitely a culmination dance… a dance that showed Rob’s transformation and skill level. Like at a recital, you give it your best shot…and that’s what Rob did. Kudos to Cheryl, it was a great Freestyle with tons of great moments and super high scores.

We're leaving them in the field for a reason. They're horrible. They're a perfect case of the illusion that everything that's an heirloom is better. Although beautiful and thoroughly purple, they were always left untouched when we cooked up a selection of potatoes.

Darlene, co-owner, took orders as people got towards the front, while Diana and the Melt Mobile staff cooked things up. Bobby was there, clapping away, giving tips, pushing them on to deal with this Stamford surprise crowd. From time to time he would poke his head out, set out some tomato soup or sandwiches, and make sure they got sent to their rightful owners. Chef Flay also helped out by grilling up the onions and mushrooms. Come on, you know Bobby’s the grill master. I got my hands on a tomato soup while we inched our way up. Yeah, that’s ridiculously ridiculous tomato soup. It’s creamy and tangy with a few chunks of tomato and some spices to round it out. Just plain awesome, and I have had a LOT of tomato soup in my day!
Despite AP’s attempt to portray claims of US-backing behind Putin’s opposition and claims of “election fraud” as “Kremlin-controlled propaganda,” the truth is rather well documented.
After I doubled clicked on the fob to unlock the doors I tossed my keys onto the passenger seat. I generally do this when I pumping gas, and tonight the pants I was wearing had no pockets so it seemed the right thing to do. However, if you double click to unlock and then don't open the back doors the car automatically re-locks. I have actually set the alarm off while sitting in the car by unlocking but not leaving the car for a few minutes. Yes, it's as awkward and embarrassing as it sounds to set off your car alarm while inside. Since I decided I didn't need my coat I never opened the back door after unlocking the car, thus leaving myself vulnerable to the auto lock ghost.
I thought I looked pretty good. I had my blonde hair flipped back on the sides, ala Farrah Fawcett, skinny jeans with high heels and I was ready to dance. My roommate, Pat, sat beside me. Pat couldn’t care less if a guy asked her to dance or not. She just went with the flow. She had these gorgeous blue eyes and short dark hair. She was tall and thin and smoked like a fiend. She had this way of inhaling a cigarette that made me want to mock her. The more she quietly drank, the more her hair fell into her eyes. She was a lot of fun to be with. Years later she was a bridesmaid in my wedding.
When finally an empty J70 arrived, everyone jumped on. Glasses were torn off heads, purses lost, suits crumbled, hairstyles ruined. The leaderman went in front to stand next to the bus driver (the red-headed woman leader was long lost by then), thinking he could control the J mob. As the bus went on, some loud fellows decided that no stops would be permitted until the bus had reached its last one, downtown.

In my humble opinion, French women are more restricted, for example, than American women. They're more conservative--which doesn't give them the mobility that we feel in life. Our American openness is a great gift that we often take for granted.

I'm sitting here on my bedroom floor surrounded by boxes and suitcases, clothes and books, jewelry and pictures, DVDs and school supplies, and the list goes on and on. I am struggling to figure out what on earth I am going to take with me and what I should leave at home. Should I leave those clothes on hangers and pack these? Do I take that or leave it home? Am I going to need this or will it be a waste of space? It's just now starting to sink in that I really am moving out. I am such a homebody that this is a huge deal for me, even if I am just moving across town. But I won't be in my beloved bedroom anymore. Anyhow, I am in here working, already trying not to really think too much about what is going on, while listening to my iPod. I have it set on "Shuffle" so that the songs are all mixed up and I can get a bit of variety in my music. What song comes on? "I Believe in You" by Steven Curtis Chapman. Of all of the 640 songs on my iPod that could have come on, of course that tear-jerker would have to come on at the perfect...or worst possible moment. If you don't already know it, that song was written by Steven Curtis Chapman for his daughter Emily when she graduated.

The explanation provided was that the defendant's design derived from documents created in 2005, ie the year before the claimants' design went to market. Despite their authenticity being challenged, the judge considered these documents genuine and accordingly there could be no question of copying in relation to them. The standout feature of the defendant's most recent design (created in 2009), which was shared by that of the claimants, was the sloping top face with the window partly on the slope and extending onto the front. However, rather than being a result of copying, the court considered that the defendant's article looked like this because it was based on their own, independently created, 2005 design. Accordingly, the only aspect of any article that was derived from the claimants was the specific shape of the side panel. Looked at as a whole, this did not amount to infringement: the defendant had not produced an article substantially to the claimants' design.

But how do we know if we’re building it right? This week I studied, a section of verses that amazed me about the mental storage unit and operation center we call a brain. What does God expect of us with this wonderful tool?

And so it comes down to Anthony Kennedy. Perhaps he will feel some small pull of humility, and not demolish Obama-Romneycare in one fell swoop. This is, however, the man who in one breath noted that while there was no data measuring it, he was on safe ground in saying that some women later come to regret their choice to abort a child, so humility may not be a governing principle at play.
Be sure to check out their flavors because they are more than likely to carry your favorite flavor. My all time favorite flavor is Irish Cream and of course they had it! The only flavor that I was not able to find is Toffee Nut, but you never know... they may come out with it in the future. I also came across some very unusual flavors such as cookie dough and German chocolate cake, which is just up my alley! Below you will find my opinions of all four of the flavors that they sent me to review.

After some light breakfast in the hangar we … went back to the ranger station to watch a movie about the park. What else to do? It was still raining so the airplanes didn’t fly. All we could do is wait for the weather to clear. After that movie there was a bit heavy lunch at the Bettles Lodge and then another movie. A movie about an older guy who hiked and the paddled all the way from Canada till the mouth of Yukon river. It took him time and money to organize this sort of trip. He actually went over that pass in Arrigetch peaks that we, at this point,were not going to. Suddenly the weather cleared a bit and we were off to the Circle Lake – our starting point.

The second issue is illustrated by Tom Neely with a cover by Langridge. Langridge described the cast: "Things are pretty much as you would expect if you know your Segar: Popeye loves Olive, Olive loves Popeye in her own fickle way, Popeye is a devoted stepfather to Swee'Pea, Wimpy's always looking for a free meal, etc. It ain't broke, so we ain't fixing it. Olive's brother Castor and their parents, Cole and Nana Oyl, are a part of the mix too. And you may spot Olive's first boyfriend, Ham Gravy, at some point, if you keep your eyes open. Other familiar faces will pop up as well. I've tried to get all of the regulars from the Segar years in there at some point, even if it's only a cameo."

I admit to being woefully misinformed. While the term ‘humus’ does commonly refer to the dark, fertile, friable stuff compost eventually turns into, the real miracle is the substance soil scientists call stable humus. This dark colloidal gel consists largely of water and carbon in many permutations (humic acids, humins, etc.), tightly bound to clay and metal hydroxides. Greatly resistant to further decomposition, it plays an essential role in providing soil structure, increases the ability of soil to store nutrients resistant to leaching, buffers acids and alkalis, binds toxic heavy metals, and can hold the equivalent of 80-90% of its weight in water. It can last in the soil for centuries and perhaps longer, sequestering water and carbon for slow release.

For those of you interested in the Berber (Tamazight) languages, there's a enew blog concentrating on those spoken in Libya and Egypt (Siwi in the Siwa Oasis, the only Berber language spoken in Egypt). The author calls it Oriental Berber, (I can see the name may raise questions, since "Oriental" carries a lot of baggage when "Eastern" might have done fine, and "Berber" may annoy some activists. It's a collaborative blog by three authors, one of them Lameen Souag of the Jabal al-Lughat and more recently the blog on Algerian Dardja etymology, الأصول التاريخية للدارجة الجزائرية, which I introduced here recently. Souag's post about the new blog is here. His other collaborators are Marijn van Putten of Phoenix's Blog, and Adam Benkato.
So, the first thing the fossil record taught us was the reality of extinction, it also taught us that our planet has experienced some very different climates and ecosystems to those we see today. In my last article I mentioned the best wrong theory in history but what might take the wooden spoon of humiliation as the worst? Flood geology; the idea that the biblical flood of Noah’s ark fame explains all of modern geology. Strictly speaking it’s not a theory at all but a doctrine and one that is so laughable and self-evidently untrue it barely warrants refutation. The distribution of fossils in geological strata is not random but ordered, corresponding entirely with evolutionary theory and is therefore predictable. This is why evolutionary scientists are employed by oil companies; the search for oil is no longer a case of digging about the place and hoping for the best. A proper understanding of geology has also explained why earthquakes and tsunamis happen and can therefore say where and when they are most likely. Critics of science often believe that it’s all mostly untestable guesswork; if your point of view is wrong results will be correspondingly wrong. The truth is that different theories make different predictions and evidence establishes which theories to reject.

The bread was good. It was a dense hearty bread that complimented dinner great and then the leftovers went great with eggs the next morning. I am hesitant to say it was a favorite though as it was just missing something. Reinhart's intro nailed it for me as he talked about how whole-grain bread bakers are challenged to attain a "crumb network that opens up both flavor and texture". That is what was missing from my bread. The crumb texture was just too tense and dry. The flavor was good but that's to my palate. I'm intrigued at how I could improve it. So, perhaps my hesitancy with this bread is not the formula but simply the bread baker's skill (that's me!) at making this bread. Another thing to ponder is the ingredients..... the whole wheat flour I used was simply from the bulk section. Perhaps I should try becoming a bit of a flour snob and search out some premium flour and give the bread a try again just to see.
So Marty, my hat is off to you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

I started blogging, would you believe it, in 2007, writing a blog called 'Dramatic Licence' to publicise the productions for my am-dram society. It was part of a community of blogs linked to the online sites for local newspapers. In between shows I added posts about my own life and, in the summer of that year, wrote a series of travel diaries, 'Mum's Gone to Iceland'. When the newspaper blogging group closed down I decided to start again and began this blog in 2009, uploading my travel diaries so they wouldn't be lost.

I doubt the owners of Fresh Market are aware of the nuances inherent in the missing sign. I imagine they have not considered their failure to replace the sign as being an abuse of authority and power. I suspect they have not connected this small absence with the accumulation of absences that is the cultural stance towards persons with disabilities.
What I will say though, is despite being over in terms of calories and not being happy about that… I have recorded (pretty much) everything on myfitnesspal. I have recorded probably 98% of what I’ve eaten now for 91 days now. I’ts becoming more and more difficult to remain honest when I know I’m eating a piece of toast and if I register it on myfitnesspal it will only rack up more and more. Am I proud or happy when I click complete my diary for the day and its 1800-2000 calories? Hell no. But at least I’m trying to keep myself somewhat in check.
This is an evolution. I see more writing in my future. Art will have its place, but my environment, having the visual energy around me, will satisfy more than the actual making of things.

What I’ve done is packed up my sheet music and every night I do mental practice. In my hotel room or when during down time, I open to the songs I’m learning and slowly and methodically mentally work through the music. Imagining my hands touching the appropriate keys at the right time. Spelling out the chord notes to myself. Trying to go through the motions in my mind. Since this is all mental practice, it’s important to work through the music at slower tempo than what the performance speed is. I read through the music about half the speed I would normally play and sometimes slower if its a complete new piece.

In Tibetan tradition, Dakini (Tibetan Khandro) is a female embodiment of enlightened energy.

With or without the 'higher' philosophical teachings, the nuns naturally embodied the Enlightened Female Energy - Dakinis of Peace.

In a new video interview, Paul Rossi, managing director and executive vice president of The Economist Group, Americas, explains why the CMR is important in today’s media landscape, “The biggest question we get today from advertisers is data. How do we know what’s working? How do we know what readers are doing with advertising in apps and on digital devices? Those are very, very good and valuable questions. So I think what we have to do is help advertisers understand that there are different ways to use our various brands and products to reach the audience and it isn’t necessarily one size fits all. The CMR will open up a conversation about data without having to justify where it’s come from or the authority of the data. It’s back to transparency, it’s back to being able to make decisions based on the same criteria.”

There is currently a steady, consistent voice telling me all the faults and character flaws I have given reign to this week and I am in complete agreement with the internal assessment. I’ve watched a couple of programs this week that give that voice tangibility. One is The Biggest Loser, the focus this season is “No Excuses,” the other is the most recent episode of Tabatha Takes Over where she’s faced with a business owner whose apathetic, uncaring response to feeling overwhelmed is to sit back and do nothing. I did say that I have been occupying myself with television, right?

I leap from sleep to start my day,
I have been neglectful, I will admit that right up front. The last week has been chock full of stuff, including a boyfriend visit over the weekend. I shall now attempt to fill in the blanks. This morning turned out to be an interesting trip. I went into town for routine blood tests, then stopped in at my local favorite home improvement store. While there, I decided to look for one thing that wasn’t on my list. A pool floatie. Last year’s model had died, and I wanted another one like it. But when I went to the aisle with the pool stuff, outside, it was blocked off. I had to go up front to locate a store person, who then looked to verify there was no apparent reason for the blockade and then called to make sure they were done. Well, they weren’t. And they also weren’t moving heavy equipment around, at least not for normal store purposes. As it turned out, a baby owl had fallen to the ground. There are a couple of barn owls who live there, which I hadn’t known before, and their new little baby had fallen out. Eventually, after giving them time to finish up, I found out that there had been 3 babies. Only one survived, and it has been replaced in the ‘nest’. Then they fortified things, so that wouldn’t happen again. I finally was able to go into that aisle, where I met up with the guy who was fixing things for the owls. He pointed out the mama owl, who was directly above the pool stuff I wanted to look at. Dad was farther away, watching over the newly replaced baby in the nest. Gosh, they’re beautiful creatures! And I was left with a feeling of awe for these lovely birds, who are pleasantly accepted by the store employees. The owls do their part and keep the rodent population down, so get fed whilst doing chores. A working bird, a happy partnership. Just hope the baby makes it.

We had a great New Year's Eve celebration with my parents. We did quite a bit, but kept it low-key. We started off by going to church in Frankfort (gotta love that Catholic Saturday night Mass).

Now we shop mainly in the produce section of the grocery store, and many of the health benefits we’ve noticed are likely a result of simply increasing our fruit/vegetable intake.
I have been enjoying the streamlined, delicious recipes from The Modern Baker. In fact I included the book as one of my favorites in my 2010 Cookbook Roundup and purchased three copies of the cookbook in hardcover: for me and for each of my daughters. If you don't have a copy, the book is now available at very reasonable cost in paperback! I was honored that Nick Malgieri recently sent a paperback copy of the book to each member of The Modern Baker Challenge.
Well, being a Lovecraft story, you can probably take a wild guess.
But the sheep guillotine? That’s crazy, right? Is that art? Would it be art if they decided not to kill the sheep? Or only if they decided not to kill it despite the results of the online vote?
Today was pretty good. I felt full for most of the day, but my blood sugar dropped on the way home so I crammed an orange and a banana in my mouth the moment I walked in the door.

Let’s not forget the E-Ink display that maximizes the battery life and is very easy to read in nearly any light (indiglow backlight).. Construction of the phone is good, call quality is better than I expected too. I give this phone 2 thumbs up and my dad loves it. So if you’ve got a child,parent, or just don’t feel like having all the bells & whistles then this phone is a smash hit!

John Lu, who had flown in from Montreal that very day, and Sylvia Kuzyk, who was a convincing vixen, were the runners-up. John wowed the audience with his natural stage ability and great parody of bad Asian films opposite scene partner Alissa Watson. Sylvia had the grace and airs down pat for a famous actress, a lovely contrast to Toni Reimer’s mousy character who has come pleading for her husband back.

BUT! Firstly I have to read and absolutely ginormous number of titles before I go on holiday mid-June (yes I know that's in three and a half weeks - eek! But I have been reading for weeks; it took rather a long time for the judges to be announced). Worse, for me is that my hands are tied when it comes to blogging about individual YA titles if they are on the list submitted by publishers.

Within ten minutes I’d established the group and posted to my primary Facebook page extending the invitation. By the end of the day more than seventy people had asked to join the cruise. We are now approaching 200! Most of my guests have chosen the names of real people who traveled on the Titanic. They’ve posted photos, comments, and much more. We’re utilizing networking sites like Pinterest to collect photos. What fun! And speaking of photos, you should see the dresses, shoes and hats my passengers plan to wear aboard the ship. We’re having a delightful time shopping for our time aboard the great luxury liner.

I didn't realize there was a target amount of money we were hoping to raise in order to accomplish all four of the initiatives, but apparently that goal was $30,000,000.

About a month ago, I bought two healthy looking chokos at the market in the hope they would sprout. Sure enough, they have, and soon they'll be planted out in the vegetable garden at the base of the fence near the chook shed. Slowly buy surely, they'll creep up the fence, up the side of the shed and cover it by January. In Australia, chook sheds and choko vines go hand in hand. It's a good cheap way to provide shade in summer, you pull it out in winter and let the sun hit the shed, then replant again in spring.
Rose Vanden Eynden has always believed in magic, which probably explains how she is able to be a writer as well as a wife, mother, medium, massage therapist, minister, and instructor. She resides in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio with her husband, twin teenaged sons, and a dachshund named after Rudyard Kipling. In her spare (!) time, she enjoys performing in live theatre, watching films, reading, and walking in the woods. An avid believer in a balanced life, she meditates and eats chocolate daily.

But first, some context. We live on Rue Oberkampf – a lively street in Paris’ 11th arrondissement. If you were looking at a map of Paris, we are just to the north west of the Ile de la Cité (Notre Dame et al – generally considered the centre of the city). Our quartier, Oberkampf, is about a ten minute walk to Bastille and the Marais, a twenty minute walk to Notre Dame, and twenty five minutes to the Left Bank (but as confirmed Right Bankers, we rarely venture over that side of the river.)

This creation of a psychological sense of entitlement by right has allowed an enormous amount of flexibility within Social Security. Within Old Age Insurance, there’s an enormous amount of welfare-like redistribution and cross-subsidization from wealthier to poorer beneficiaries, and many Social Security recipients never contributed anything close to their lifetime benefit. Supplemental Security Income is basically a welfare program for poor seniors set inside a social insurance program, and it’s survived 37 years basically untouched because of that.

The past season of Community has been something special. It’s not just that it’s been consistently hilarious or that the characters are relatable and interesting. Almost every episode has been a giant middle finger to the very idea that there are limits to what can be done with a half hour of television. This is how TV should be made: with an eye for detail, a pure joy in the craft and an unrelenting commitment to the unexpected. The question of exactly which episodes are the very best of season two is such an important one that I felt I should get a second, third and fourth opinion, so joining me on this one are Steve, Sara and Katie. I promise that these are expert opinions. I know a lot of people who watch Community, but none of them know the ins and outs of every episode like these three. I don’t agree with all of their opinions, but I respect them 100%.
When broken down to three simple steps it looks pretty easy, right? Think about it this way. I treat my pencils something like...well...copics. :) I lay down a light even layer of color in each section, blend that smooth, then go back with a darker tone and scribble a bit into the lighter areas, blend that out. Repeat if I'm using a third, darker tone. I find that this style of coloring and blending gives me something that falls about half way between watercoloring and copics. Easy as 1, 2, 3! Let's take a closer look at each monster.

My friend Ed, a high school band director, always tells his band members "The worst mistake in music is a wrong note played tentatively - right or wrong, play like you mean it." The same applies in life. Make your mistakes with all your heart. Then admit your mistakes, and move on or try again. With all your heart. Always with all your heart.
This is still another area that astonishes me. This is the POD publisher’s open doorway. This should be about the candle in the window, the lick of fresh paint every few years, a few books here or there. Yet, it’s sometimes the area of a POD publisher’s business which is the weakest. I have seen it all, bad links, gaudy colours, grammatical mistakes on their welcome page! Not a friggin’ book in sight! No updates on the site for months on end, doesn’t anything change in your world? What the hell are you guys trying to say to any perspective authors? I have to put my hand up here. This is the weakest point for my own publishers. It’s no wonder the traditional publishing world turns their noses up at all of you. Go have a look at Random House, Faber & Faber, Collins-Harville, Bloomsbury, Penguin...You may at least learn how to present a professional image!

I've been having some fun on a website called Bad Translator. You type or paste up to 250 characters of text, choose the translator program and number of translations you want, then wait for the magic to happen. Your phrase will be translated from one language to another in random order, and the final result is usually funny and quite different from the original.

After trying a few different methods I thought I'd share what worked best for me.
Good morning, lovelies! And happy Monday to you! Hope you all had a lovely weekend.
Chicken Quesadilla. By far my favorite of all the flavors, had a nice smoky chipotle flavor with the black beans and colby cheese. Definitely get this one along with the beef picadillo. The Teriyaki Chicken looked similar on the inside, and I would say it was tied in 3rd place with the Buffalo Chicken one in terms of what I liked the best.

And holy smokes, does that cover look pretty. I'll fully admit that I judge a book by its cover - at least at first. Also, by its font, the texture of its pages, its smell. All love starts with lust. Or at least it does with me. But these books are worth that first flush of desire. They're sly. Meaty. Heartbreaking. And I can't WAIT for the next installment.
These companies are taking over fertile agricultural land and sacred sites and uprooting whole villages. They are displacing thousands of indigenous people – robbing them of their homes, destroying their livelihoods and culture, and reducing them to refugees in their own country. With little concern for India’s environmental laws, many of these companies are also destroying the land itself, not only for now but for generations to come, as they rip off the topsoil and pollute rivers and streams for miles with toxic effluents and poisonous mud.

Dwight, like T. Roosevelt at first glance does not seem fairly socialist. He was a Republican. He was a five-star general who put all of Western Europe under the stars and stripes. He became the super commander of NATO, intervened in Iran and Guatemala to topple left leaning democratic leaders and replace them in national interest. But all this doesn’t diminish his socialist aspect. After all, did not Trotsky believe in a world revolution? Did not the Comintern specialise in the creation in the contamination of precious bodily fluids across the world? The fact remains that although Ike fought the Soviets back like a true patriotic son, his national policy would be condemned as socialist if put forward today. What did he do? Well for starters the top tax rate in Eisenhower’s reign was 94%. Today Obama’s trying on his class warfare to raise it to 40%. He ordered the state build highways, rather than rely on friendly private corporations and expanded exponentially on the disgusting social security FDR forced on the brave American populace. He also tyrannically placed in troops to enforce educational integration at Little Rock, Arkansas. Astronomical taxes, builds autobahns, gives money to filthy poor folk, makes war on conservative values. Eisenhower is undoubtedly a Red. If only McCarthy had spotted him and acted accordingly.

After going by Mile 7 I knew it was coming. The split off for the half marathon. The numbers for the full were 1-4,000 at the Expo. I figured we’d basically lose EVERYONE and be alone at the split. Having run the race twice before (half) I had longingly and apprehensively looked at the runners going straight. Thinking they were just getting started. With so many miles to go. And wishing (dreading) to be one of them. I was actually really excited about this point in the race because the course was “unknown” to me then.
It's worth remembering that if an editor or agent can’t connect with your characters and story, then the general reading public certainly won’t.

Most of you have heard that Travis and I both came across a book called Reclaiming Adoption, Missional Living through the Rediscovery of Abba Father. Right before Christmas, via a twitter direct message (oh, so thankful for social media!) Dan asked us if anyone in our church might want to host a house conference. So, yes, we were like 4 year olds in preschool raising our heads and stretching out of our seats hoping the teacher calls us on. Yes, Dan, pick us! Pick us. Okay, so Travis is a bit more subdued and probably didn't make as much of a scene as I did; but he was equally thrilled.

I'm also trying to convince our six-year-old that having her own bedroom will be amazing and wonderful and full of pink (without shocking our senses.) One night I even made up a story about a princess (with her name) moving to a new castle (house.) That's how desperate I am for this transition to be a positive one.

If you’re put off by the prospect of making your own, though, three main brands are common enough to find on the shelf at your local boozery or through online vendors ; Bols (from Holland), Verpoorten (Germany), and Warninks (made by DeKuyper Royal Distillers in Holland). A bottle of any of these is readily available for $17-28.
These words were sung last night to a packed church by the Dordt College Choir (my husband and son’s alma mater) now on their spring tour. It was a touching and beautiful evening of wonderful choral music by a group of students who clearly care deeply about sharing their faith, led by a talented and dedicated conductor who grew up in our town of Lynden, Dr. Ben Kornelis.
Yesterday at the dinner table a new sign made its appearance: eye-rolling! My goodness. And last week, after a family dinner in our little downtown, he ditched us to hang out with his friends on First Friday (when the shops are open past 5 or 6). He was part of a roaming pack of teenagers! (We sort of observed at a distance for part of the time and hoped, when they were out of sight, that they were behaving nicely.)
Because I am oblivious to the obvious – I only found out it was Friday the 13th AFTER I was laying flat on my back on a table next to what looks like a big battery with jumper cables and a mini stun gun hanging off. Imagine the look on my face when Tech Girl, a nice enough woman who is educated, well put together, but beyond frazzled, says to me, “So how’s your Friday the 13th going?” I said we’d see when she was done with me. I tried to laugh in a small talk kinda way, because when the woman with electricity has the zapper in hand, you laugh at what THEY think is funny.

5. Finally, even if you concede the rest of the argument, Habermas’s conclusion requires you to assess the probability of whatever ad hoc theory you concoct at argument #4 and weigh it against the probability that the resurrection actually occurred. This is conceptually impossible, and not simply for the reasons given by David Hume. Any comparative analysis requires you to assign some nonzero value to Pr(R|B), which is the probability of the resurrection given our background knowledge. If Pr(R|B) is zero, then Pr(R|B&E) — the probability of the resurrection given our background knowledge and some new evidence E — is also zero via Bayes’ theorem.

One of the few good bits from Garlic Jr. is Chi-Chi getting so angry at Maron's insults that it looks like she learned Goku's Kaio-Ken attack. Who's Maron? Another filler character that's Krillin's first girlfriend for the anime. Maron has the looks of super model and the intelligence of a brick. In episode 117 (episode 10) of the Garlic Jr. Saga, Krillin question's proposing to her, but in feeling that she's way out of his league, he breaks up with her. It was some nice character development for Krillin as he's always wanted a girlfriend but deep down, he probably knew how shallow she was and that she wasn't the girl for him, something Master Roshi states later on in this season. The final episode in the Garlic Jr. Saga ended up being the only one I really liked as I just couldn't get into the Z Fighters struggle against such lame villains.

Once again, like with the other Medical Brigades, this one ran smoothly and efficiently. Check-in, triage, doctor’s “office”, pharmacy and the dental section for adults and children. And I must say, it was rather amazing to see how patient the children were, as students and GB staffers filled their mouths with trays of fluoride goo, and not see one complain or even pitch a fit.

Who is Judas Iscariot, we know very little about him even his last name Iscariot doesn't provide any clues. All we know for sure was that he was one of Jesus' 12 disciples and he was an Apocalypse Jew who believed the world as he knew it would end shortly. Ehrman surmises that the disciples expected to be in charge after the apocalypse with Jesus as their leader.

We singles are all looking for that starburst of wonder and goodwill, elusive as it might be. There's no way to pre-figure the feeling, the chemistry follows no particular rules.

Fortunately, my better nature prevented anything more happening. There are quite a few what-ifs hanging out there in the universe.

So I’m going to share my story about the havoc that my body has wreaked on me starting last night…

There is a great deal in Nietzsche that must be dismissed as merely megalomaniac… It is obvious that in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all the men he admires were military. His opinion of women, like every man’s, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear. “Forget not thy whip”–but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks.

For the last couple of weeks I've been blotting ink from my projects onto the pages of a book (after seeing the Queen of journalling, Dyan Reaveley do this) and also trying out distress stains and watercolours on different pages.

I’ll give you an example: I heard a certain person say, during Operation Cast Lead, that we have to cause the other side to understand that ba’al habayit hishtagea – that Israel has “gone crazy.” That’s absolutely unacceptable. In fact, we have to cause them to appreciate the very opposite: that Israel is anything but crazy. That Israel acts aggressively only because it has no chance. It hits people only because it has to. It hits non-dangerous people only in a case of collateral damage, while making immense efforts not to harm them.

Yeah, if there’s one thing I associate with Bobby Petrino, it’s memorable catch phrases.
The central figure in the tale is Chaim Salanter, a Jewish man who is one of the world’s wealthiest persons. His past includes a boyhood escape from his homeland, Lithuania, during the Nazi occupation. Salanter is a grandfather with secrets and an ideal target for anyone who wishes to drag his name through the mud. Although this novel reaches into the past, it is firmly grounded in the present thanks to the not-so-charming antics of a group of tweens – including Salanter’s only grandchild – who are fixated on a series of books about vampires. Paretsky also adds into the mix some right-wing politicians and broadcasters who are out to get Salanter and the liberal politician he is backing, which makes this an only-in-Chicago kind of story.

What was the point of my reference? Simple; people never see how much gays and lesbians go through daily just because of their alternative orientation. In recent history, lots of homosexuals have actually committed suicide because they felt I was the only way out; and the spineless cowards who pushed this don’t even care, and in fact in the end; are actually glad the person was gone. They respect us straight people, so why can’t we show the same?

Under the Scotland Act, all ministers of the Scottish Executive must act in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). It is illegal to act contrary to the ECHR. As head of the prosecution service in Scotland the Lord Advocate is obliged to act in accordance with the ECHR. Where it is alleged that the prosecution have failed to do so, by acting in a way which infringes the accused’s ECHR rights, then such a minute is lodged.

On the fiction side, Ali Dougal said that the market continues to be dominated by PARANORMAL fiction, though ‘Twilight’ has finally seen a dip in demand. Those that are hot right now are about Angels and Werewolves. Books that have made it into film are big sellers for publishers, such as the Percy Jackson series. For Egmont, the biggest revenue continues to come from their backlist which includes Enid Blyton books (now being repackaged). Due to Steven Spielberg’s upcoming film ‘Warhorse’, the corresponding book has become Egmont’s very own ‘Twilight’. Other successful books are the ‘GONE’ series, as well as ‘Mr. Gum’ and ‘Lemony Snicket’. Egmont has obviously also followed the Paranormal trend, as seen through ‘The Dark Divine’ books (by Bree Despain). They also have an Angel trilogy coming out.

We found Ninja one day in our house because we had left the window open for Bob and there she was without a collar just sat on our table she was quite big so my mum said we can’t feed her because then she will think it is her home so we just left her happy as Larry just sat on the table. After that she just kept coming into our house so we started putting out lost and found posters up around were we live and waited for a response when no response came we caught her and took her to the vets to see if she had a chip and she didn’t so we took her home

Case in point: Just over one year ago in late March 2011, mainstream analysts conjectured about the probability of a Portuguese bailout. Many people had opinions, but no one was talking about the most important indicator, namely that Portugal’s borrowing costs had just crossed a critical threshold. No one, that is, except EWI European market analyst Brian Whitmer.
Then when you didn’t get out right away, I had the meltdown because of the realization that you might be in there awhile. And it was probably a bit of meltdown left over from the initial shock of you being in there in the first place.

That was a tricky bet for Apple. The lessons of the past were learned, and it may be the mistake Amazon are making with the dedicated Kindle - just as publishers once believed the print book was sacred – Amazon may learn the Kindle does not equal the ebook alone. There are no mugs in Amazon and the launch of Amazon Publishing may be about to change a lot of things in the publishing industry. But I don’t expect them to petition the Oxford English Dictionary to have ‘Kindle’ replace ebook, just as it was commonplace for ‘Hoover’ to replace vacuum cleaner.

The last time I wrote about children and cooking I had a wonderful response so I figured that once a month I would write a post “food related” for cooking with your children.
The aberration of philosophy is that, instead of seing in logic and the categories of reason means toward the adjustment of the world for utilitarian ends (basically, toward an expedient falsification), one believed one possessed in them the criterion of truth and reality. The "criterion of truth" was in fact merely the biological utility of such a system of systematic falsification; and since a species of animals knows of nothing more important than its own preservation, one might indeed be permitted to speak here of "truth." The naivete was to take an anthropocentric idiosyncrasy as the measure of things, as the rule for determining "real" and "unreal": in short, to make absolute something conditioned. And behold, suddenly the world fell apart into a "true" world and an "apparent" world: and precisely the world that man's reason had devised for him to live and settle in was discredited. Instead of employing the forms as a tool for making the world manageable and calculable, the madness of philosophers divined that in these categories is presented the concept of that world to which the one in which man lives does not correspond--The means were misunderstood as measures of value, even as a condemnation of their real intention--

I was looking through Etsy when I saw someone had some wool dryer balls up for sale. I have sooo much wool upstairs that I bought to make longies for the babies out of and just haven't gotten round to so I decided to use some of it to make myself some dryer balls. This is by no means my own pattern, people have been doing this for years and years, I just thought I'd put on here how I did it in case someone else wants to make some too :)

Well then you replace the fishing dudes with young dudes with beards and hand cream issues at bbqs, where shock horror there are women. Of course then you are VB. And if you are VB your market share has dropped by 12% in the last year (whilst XXXX grew by 9%) and if you were the advertising agency working on VB you’d get sacked.

If you think about it, there are many possible sources your players could get this information from. They might read it in the newspaper archives, they might learn it from one of Pr.Smiths students, or one of the his co-workers at the university, or they might find a letter in Pr. Smiths desk, a picture on his wall. It's not important where they will get the information from. So make it easy for your players. Reward their ideas by giving them the clues they need to advance the story wherever they cared to look.

Warping things up with today's 2 to 3-D ideas lets take a look at a lesson often referred to as "Common threads." I've seen this lesson done by several teachers but I think I have tracked the original idea to Bunki Kramer of Los Cerros MS. I don't know if she still teachers, but there are amazing lessons on her school website.
Here's Jeff, surveying his handiwork.

Saaru / rasam is prepared with toor dal and tomatoes. The regular spice mix for rasam is not used. Here the flavor is from the cumin-pepper powder. Also for the regular rasam, the seasoning is prepared with mustard, cumin seeds. As mustard is not used during this time ,only cumin seasoning is used.
1. Adjust 2 oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil and spray with vegetable oil spray. Arrange the sliced eggplant on the baking sheets, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Bake until light golden brown, about 15-20 minutes, rotating pans halfway through the roasting time. Set aside to cool. Leave the oven on, reducing the temperature to 400 degrees.
So that's where I am. I still have about 100 pounds to lose, but that's not what I focus on. Overall health is my goal, so I'm working on eating better and moving more (sound familiar?).
And what exacerbates a drop in oil production is that it takes many, many years for production to return to pre-war levels - anywhere from 5 to 15 years. So, in a worst case scenario of war with multiple oil producing Islamic nations involved, oil will likely reach devastating highs and stay there for several years before a return to normalcy.

The movie attempts to give a “lesson” to viewers on what happens when you whore-yourself out (or fake whore-yourself-out in this case) and how people can be judgmental/start rumors/yadda yadda yadda. The message to me was skewed by the terrible plot/acting…yikes!
That said, maybe it's not right to frame this opinion as placing an "additional" burden on TDCJ or the counties, because really they had that burden all the time and just weren't carrying their full weight. The state has been skating on parolees' rights in the name of cost and convenience for many years, with state courts going along to get along. So it's rather startling to see the CCA finally focused on parolee due process questions. They're opening a can of worms that won't close any time soon.
PRESS RELEASES FOR RCE? I can understand companies wanting to promote their own technologies, but Paid, Inc. is apparently publishing press releases over their decision to file an RCE.
Given the opportunity, kids love to be out in the woods or in a field, searching for bugs and sticks, flowers and rocks. Showing them that you can eat some of those plants should not be scary, but fun. With a little caution, and plenty of encouragement, the kids will be able to positively identify many common and safe wild edibles. With simple explanations and repetition, children will absorb information without realizing they are learning something, they will just think that eating stuff outside is cool.
When we use rape as a casual term in everyday language (for example, to express something has gone poorly – “man, our project proposal totally got raped in that meeting”), we are equating rape to an mildly unpleasant event or a hard day.

I have learned much this year. I learned the importance of importance. If there is nothing of importance in your life, you have to find something and make it important. I learned the importance of goals, even if it’s only the goal of getting through one more day. I learned the importance of hope, though hope for what I still don’t know, but that is part of the journey – building hopes, creating dreams, finding reasons to live.

Can a hipster not be an artist as well? I can’t help but take this personally, because I go to an art school and I’m a hipster. I’m sure a lot of people assume that art school is full of super-nerds and hipsters. Which is true, to some degree. In fact, I know hipsters at my school (including myself) that are highly motivated and are into art because they enjoy art and are talented artists. Yeah, I know Granfield is being sarcastic when the character says “hipsters…can’t be too motivated,” but many view the subculture in this manner – hipsters are posers, pretending to be characters that they are not.

Throughout the movie, there is plenty of swearing, nudity, gross-out moments and plenty of laughs. But along the way, it does get a bit sentimental as the boys realise they haven’t got where they wanted in life, that they aren’t having as much fun as they thought and maybe what they had in high school was better than what they have now growing up. Being back in their home town makes them realise how much things have changed and makes them assess whether they like that change. I like this heart-felt side of the movie.
Obviously the goblins were not digging. The PC’s find lost tools of high quality and that the doorway in the stone platform leads down into the earth. The PCs recalled the words of Miriam, strangely prophetic. Without orders to delve inside, the PC’s turn to the goblin leader. Surprisingly the creature can speak limited common and after some intimidation and an open treat of death and disposal, the goblin relents and informs them they came from the Underdark, escaped slaves of the Drow living deep below. The PC’s finish with the creature, feeling sure they were not followed by their far more dangerous former masters and let the pathetic thing go with a pack of food and no weapons or his drow marked chain shirt. Gwig took down their position and noted the details before the party headed back to the Stead and made their report. Offered food and drink for their efforts, Graen was most appreciative. Miriam, babbling in the background tells Gwig danger will come screaming from the sky and then falls back into doddering around the house. The party mounts up, saying their goodbyes and heads out to Pembrooke.
Do not be fooled by slick video editing. Sleeping outside in downtown Pittsburgh will not help anyone who is still night commuting in northern Uganda. Perhaps you are now aware that there is a problem, perhaps you know that there is more to this world than just your country, your state, and your little hometown. What you may not know is that the US government is not going to get involved if it doesn’t benefit the American people. Remember Rwanda? It is up to you to figure out how to deal with this knowledge and the knowledge that your warm and fuzzy thoughts are not going to be the solution to this.

This recording session involving leaders Pandelis Karayorgis and Mat Maneri along with their supporting cast (Tony Malaby, Michael Formanek, and Randy Peterson -- all musicians they had both worked with before) was put together hastily. It falls to the jazzmen's credit that Disambiguation sounds so unforced and rehearsed, and flows so naturally. The pianist and violist know each other well enough to share a level of comfort that often finds improv musicians turning lazy and remaining on previously charted ground. If this quintet doesn't explore new, cutting-edge territories, it sure can't be accused of laziness. Karayorgis came up with five loose compositions: heads and sub-group sequences (a bass/piano duet here, a trio section there, etc.). The group members made the music their own (rather than "learned" it) and recorded it as if they had been playing it for years. Nothing here stands out of the ordinary: the pianist's tumbling lines, Maneri's deep viola lines, the rhythm section playing in and out often at the same time. Detractors of free jazz will say that this has been done before, and so forth. But these five players do it well, more than that they do it casually. Unpretentiously, like it is their everyday bread and butter, they pour their hearts and souls into Karayorgis' post-bop themes (that Monk signature again in the opening theme of "Three Plus Three"), break down their sound into every possible combination of players to show everything they can do, and bring it softly "Home" in the end. All in a day's work, right? Disambiguation is the work of professionals still thrilled by what they do.
O’Hara agrees to work on Elsa’s yacht, despite being aware that Elsa’s husband, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) is on board. Arthur is of all things a criminal defense attorney, the best in the country. Elsa and Arthur, along with George Grisby (Glenn Anders), Arthur’s partner at their law firm, spend their time drinking profusely and exchanging bitter verbal jabs. O’Hara quickly realizes he is in over his head but stays when he is offered $5,000 dollars to take credit for a fake murder, which will enable him to run off with Elsa.

The unexpected will always happen. You need to know when your plan isn’t working, or at least KNOW when help is required and/or a change of plans is needed. The most common reason for students needing a change of plan is that they run out of time. The golden rule here is: simplify. Whatever your original plan was, make it easier, focus on the main points – 30 days… simplified action.

The problem the Prime Minister faces in this instance is that there is barely a British citizen left who believes his account of the relationship he enjoyed with Newscorp and its senior executives. He refused to give a straight answer to the ‘Christmas lunch’ questions…and his reluctance is now explained in the worst possible way. He refused to damn Andy Coulson…and is now seen to have defended the indefensible. He blithely suggests that he and Rebekah Brooks were not close….omitting to mention that he and Mrs Cameron once left their late son on a beach in the sole care of that woman. He insists that there was no ‘quid pro quo’ between Newscorp support for the Conservative Party in 201o….but is then discovered to have discussed that support with James Murdoch, to have fired Vince Cable for his opinion about Murdoch (now entirely vindicated); to have replaced him with a man whose own website hailed Rupert Murdoch as a genius; but when that replacement’s impropriety comes to light, he defends him to the hilt…rather than firing him.
The Orpheum was packed for the show. Ed Sheeran is a young gentleman from the UK via Hollywood (or vise versa? He was born in the UK, but moved to LA). There was a considerable amount of hype surrounding this folky-hip hoppstery-beat boxer (seriously he does a variety of things). Immediately I ran into a group of girls excited for Ed! His show was exceptional… I’d say my biggest concern was that it was too short. I’d be surprised if he played more than 4 songs. You can tell he is young and enjoying the crowds. He is still learning how to handle the huge audience… Musically; he was on-point.

This can be a bit tricky. Since an OPK does not “read” the same as a HPT. A line is NOT always a positive line on an OPK. You will need your test line to be darker than or as dark as the control line. A faint test line only indicates some LH being picked up, not your surge. So keep testing until your test line gets as dark as the control line.

This text is distinctive because the writers openly call attention to silence as a rhetorical, linguistic sign. Expanding this text to consider the impact of the French Revolution, two themes start to emerge, the silence and suppression part. All you have to do is write, write about how your first chapter comes first because you want to introduce this idea of the French Revolution as somehow related to this uptick in silent works, works that are interested in the ways that language can somehow express absence, whatever, absence of understanding, feeling, thought, it’s about the not understanding, the sense of loss that romantic writers felt, they felt frustrated, confused, like, what is happening in the world? And the only way they could come to terms with this was by looking to nature, like I haven’t said that a million times before

It's a far out psychedelic space rock epic. The first two tracks are really great jams not unlike those of Brainticket or Can, with longing vocals that don't make much sense and all kinds of heavy loose grooves gliding along. The second side is mostly a more mellow track, with spacey drawn-out guitar sketches and ending with a build of drums and bass. It's a really nice example of the more spaced-out side of progressive rock, created with as much energy as anything. - Matthew Foster

Although environment, safety and health have become the important points of considerations, the end users, in many cases do not place primary importance that how the product is made. The product may look and feel the same but is the composition, health and safety aspects, quality and its performance standards measured on the same basis as per the requirement of Indian constructions and atmosphere. In India, most of the people prefer imported waterproofing membranes but if any failure is there after five years then who will be held responsible. Our membrane is the only polymeric membrane manufactured in our own country and can be custom designed like we can increase or decrease the tensile strength, puncture resistance, thickness etc as per the individual requirement.

The Home Secretary was to ask the Inter Departmental Committee, which was chaired by the Home Office, to look into preventing an increase in the number coming for employment. There is a note to R.J.Guppy of the Home Office in The Prime Ministers papers notifying him that Churchill had seen the report in that day's Daily Telegraph "about what is termed an influx of West Indians. He is considering bringing the matter before the Cabinet and would like to have a report from the Home Secretary about it." (8)

ABOUT iloveRobots
I remember the first time a best friend lied to me. It broke my heart. It was just a little, irrelevant lie, so I was surprised that it hurt so much. I think that because we were such good friends, that she wouldn’t feel the need to lie. I already understood lying. This seemed different. I now understand that the level of growth I was at, at that time was to learn how unimportant lies really are. I had stories of rug being pulled out from under me before and always tried to go to that place of ‘finding the gift’ and that if I loved them enough once to call them my friend, then I loved them enough to get over anything with them. This often baffled a few people in my life, however it seemed so much important to me that the rest of the ‘stuff’ that happens. Once again I have found myself feeling a bit let down by the actions of someone I deemed to be of higher of integrity. So, I am reminded that first, don’t take things personally, and second, that is better to know up front that some people aren’t living in integrity, and it is better to know this than to wonder if you reading the situation wrong and second guessing yourself.

Plastic wrap suffocates the living cheese, trapping in its exhalate (gas and moisture just like breath and sweat) thereby encouraging bacteria growth on your precious bundles of joy. Plastic wrap then traps the off-odors that cheese produce naturally (like ammonia) from being dissipated. It doesn't take too much imagination to see where the term "cutting the cheese" comes from when you unwrap a nice cheese after a couple of days in plastic. Let's put it plainly: BO and bad breath do not a fine cheese make.

Many will say that this election year is not about race that it’s about the American people, but those same people will cast their vote only to remove the country’s first Black president. These similar acts of voting are playing out across the country. Very few black democrats or republicans have even made it through the initial voting to make it to the primaries and now this trend has nearly removed all black senators from the Senate.
So it turned out that sometimes a dream job is to be a loving and caring person whose mission is to make “the children in the shadow” in normal kids who want to study and to make them understand that they are strong people who can have dreams and that they have to struggle to make their life better.

However at around 9pm, with the entire community now on high alert and in touch with each other through their community-policing forum radios and cellphones, a woman alerted a community security guard to the three men: she’d spotted them, hiding beneath a bush in a neighbour's backyard.
The end of the academic year looms large at the moment, and I’ve been taking some time to produce the practical coursework that will be required of me on Thursday. What you see in the picture is a full over full wax pattern, which will be used to make two plaster moulds. Those moulds will be filled with high-impact acrylic to make two dentures ready for trimming and final finishing, and I’ll be doing that tomorrow.
The other component of Twitter are the chats. I have social media friends that use these chats to interact with their blog followers and provide an interview component to their topics allowing a group to participate real-time. So it seems that this is a truly interactive use of technology that engages the patients and the providers and doesn’t act solely as a marketing tool.
The journal is a bit subdued, I suppose, but I love the quote I found to put on it. No idea who to credit it to. It seems a bit blurred in the picture. It says "Beauty without expression is boring."

My ex left when my daughter was 13 and my son 14. I felt abandoned as a parent. I didn’t know how I was going to manage two teenagers on my own and all the chores. I panicked at the thought. Every time I had a struggle with one of them for whatever reason I felt bitter resentment build toward my ex for leaving me alone to deal.

northwestern part of the United States with my wife and infant son. I enjoy telling stories, especially when they include fantastical elements of some kind. My favorite part is developing a storyline. There’s something about connecting the dots of a plot to make things work that gives me a high. My favorite book series is Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, I also love the Harry Potter book series, enjoy music and playing guitar, am adopted, and I routinely toss pennies on the ground so that kids and superstitious people can find them and have their day brightened.

Our spring cleaning will be a summer’s cleaning. Since we won’t be pressured to move right away in the apartment because the trailer is 15 minutes from there and we can live there as long as we want, we will be able to clean, paint and place everything without having to live in a mess.
Hopefully Mr. Perry will come away from his brush with the long arm of the law with an awareness that he needs to do more to help people understand that black people are more than just foul mouthed characters always toting a gun. Maybe he can do something to promote the idea that black people are people too. He’s done well with his minstrel show. Maybe it’s time to do something a little more sophisticated that can help undo some of the damage characters like Madea have already done.

The old town by the Cathedral is beautiful and full of history: Drury Lane theatres are not only in London; the Bull Ring not only in Birmingham. So there is more to Wakefield than rhubarb – and actually the infamous rhubarb festival is only six years old. But if you do decide as a town to brand yourself on rhubarb, surely the coffee shops and tea rooms should be getting in on the act: why didn’t I see any rhubarb tart, rhubarb crumble or even rhubarb cake to have with my cuppa?

6) Pinocchio in 1940 became extra expensive because Walt shut down the production to make the puppet more sympathetic than the lying juvenile delinquent as presented in the original Carlo Collodi story. He also resurrected a minor character, an unnamed cricket who tried to tell Pinocchio the difference between right and wrong until the puppet killed him with the mallet. Excited by the development of Jiminy Cricket plus the revamped, misguided rather than rotten Pinocchio, Walt poured extra money into the film’s special effects and it ended up losing a million dollars in its first release.

After listening to this album, you might agree with me that it is somewhat difficult to give a track by track description. Most of the songs feature BSE's increasingly iconic and identifiable dark ambient backdrops, often augmented by choice samples in English and (possibly) Swedish and sparsely introspective guitar and/or piano segments. My personal favorites are "Funerals" and "Standing Silent": the former being a dark minimalist masterpiece opening the album with the grim quote which opened this review and the later incorporating an awesome multi-segment choir movement in its midsection that seriously has to be heard to be believed. That is not to say that the other tracks are not worthy of mention: the featured track "Long The Nights" is almost frightening in the manner in which its strings hover around you, whereas "The Only Alternative" is darkly speculative in the extended contemplation of "The Only Alternative" (aided by subconscious drones and echoing choirs).

I did not mind that it had a longer lash band since I do like using these when I attempt the gyaru dolly look. However, I do know some do not like trimming since they find it a waste - you can see that there is more volume at the outer end so it changes the look the lashes give you. It may bother some but it all depends on what overall look you are going for.

I've been working on the Name Game Swap as well, where I make a mini quilt with the name of my partner or partner's blog on it. That has been difficult as I have a very silent partner, not a peep out of her since the swap began. I'm hoping she will like it anyway.

Our Father God created us to be in relationship with Him. Not from a distance but in-person. Walking side by side with Him. This life we are living is a shadow of the life He created us for. Our bodies groan and cry out for the real life we were made for (Romans 8:23, 2 Corinthians 5:4).

First thing, was the mold on the corner of the ceiling, under the roof leak. I know, you're supposed to fix the roof leak first! Well Jim is an Olde Yankee, and they never ask for help. He has worked on that section of roof 2 or 3 times now, and it still leaks. He can't fix the ceiling till the roof stops leaking, and it's winter and dangerous, etc. I was going to bleach it. But the more I thought of bleaching over my head, the less appealing that sounded. So I covered it with plastic (on a slant, so any new drips would drain off) and I covered the plastic with a white sheet. Clever? (slipshod, I know.)

i cooked my first bird ever yesterday! it turned out pretty darn good. i used a cajun spice blend on in, and also made cornbread stuffing and cream biscuits, all from a southern menu. the hardest part about cooking the feast was getting the timing right. having everything done (and hot) at the same time is tricky. but, it worked out pretty good. and we had plenty of good, cajun spiced gravy. one of my thanksgiving pet peeves is not enough gravy.

There are few designers that make you want to twirl. Azzedine Alaïa is one of them. It's undeniable that Alaïa is one of the greatest couturiers today. The other day my friends and I came to the conclusion that his technical, draping and cutting skills are up there with the likes of Christian Dior. If you could have one designer design all your clothing (or at the very least your shoes), you would want it to be Alaïa. The silhouettes are always gorgeous.

Can anyone see the sense in this? Take a series of everyman pocket paperbacks like The Fontana Book Of Great Ghost Stories, which, in their day were available in just about every newsagent and supermarket up and down the country, and like as not got several people on here reading the stuff. Make a random selection from volumes 17-20. Get Les Edwards to design you a terrific cover, fully in sympathy with the original series. Now, have the thing printed, making sure it’s as unnecessarily bulky as possible, and run off just enough copies so that it sells out prior to publication. Appealing to the “I’ve still got my factory sealed, never been opened, worth a bomb!” non-reading market is all very well, but it’s also driving another stake into the heart of what’s supposed to be ‘popular fiction’. Hope they won an award for it.

David Karaffa brings a solid Conservative perspective to the process of solving problems facing local government.
It is only since the judaisation of the UK became endemic after the slaughter of the UK's finest in two Zionist World Wars, that femininity came under serious attack. European women have always been honoured by their men folk. Motherhood is a noble and rewarding vocation which no form of employment can rival. The labelling of motherhood as a chore which denies a woman her freedom is pure evil. Only by breaking real families can the Talmudic destruction of the Goyim be achieved. Getting girls to behave as unpaid prostitutes acclimatises them to a belief that promiscuity is normal and faithfulness is a perversion. This tragic phenomenon has only become so prevalent through the concerted effort of the Talmudist in government and their kin in the media and entertainment industry. It is not the norm, nor ever has been.

I choose a main course, a perfectly cooked chunk of tender beef served with roasted new potatoes and a red wine sauce with crispy onions and pepper berries. This 17 Euro lunchtime formula also includes a glass of wine, an interesting red that Mithu chooses for me, and a starter or dessert. I opt for the dessert, knowing that their Panna Cotta is a miracle of flavours and textures, a classic dish that here subtly changes with the season. This time it was infused with vanilla and served with thin, crisp slices of apple and a smooth salted butter caramel sauce.

Finishing "Grass for Sarah" was one of those big exhale moments. The process had consumed my thoughts since the morning of April 1st, and the physical labor demanded over one hundred twenty hours, the bulk of which was input during April vacation. There were lots of cuts and scrapes and sore fingers and moments of "starting over". There are at least 11 panels that did not make it onto the final piece and the frame was built three times. But all was a necessary part of the process and nuggets of ideas have been sparked for future pieces.

You can often get a good handle on this from the language of the job description and the history of the role. The information provided will use more dynamic language if they are looking for the type of person who sees this as a transition role, or more subdued language if the culture of the organisation is such that they prefer a person who is likely to settle in for the long-haul.
We have lost a great man. Who will take up the fight that he was fighting? Who will stand up for those who can not stand up for themselves? Who will fight to make sure our rights are protected? Who will be the next man of integrity? I pray that we do not have to wait long. However, I pray that we don't just wait for the next man of integrity to come. We also have an accounting for our actions before God. We need to fight for our rights. We need to trust God to lead us and use us in the battle before us as we are going to be facing more and more battles. We live in a world that is against us and an enemy who is fighting to make sure that we fail. God is mighty. God is powerful and God will win – with or without us. I would rather be a part of this fight than not.
So fun and easy!

It’s a pretty harsh message for a country to essentially give up on a city. The state of California recently considered a plan to do something similar in the economically troubled — and some say corrupt — city of Vernon. That plan was rejected by the state legislature, mainly over concerns that its passage would harm the local economy further. It’s tough to say what the exact result will be in the newly enlarged Hefei, but even a modest reduction in the city’s 17 percent growth rate would be hard for Chinese officials to worry about.

The Afghan war has been employed by the U.S. and NATO to forge an unprecedented 50-nation interoperable military force and the bloc has formalized the arrangements initiated to that end with its new Strategic Concept adopted at the last NATO summit in Portugal in late 2010.

My paternal grandmother took a job as a maid when she first arrived in Sao Paulo. My paternal grandfather first worked in construction and then became a taxi driver. Eventually, after much hard work, they had enough to enjoy a good life. They build a four-bedroom house with their own hands, purchased cars, TVs… they soon became part of the middle class. Each of their four children when to University and became professionals – three engineers and one teacher – one even became a millionaire. Serving the wealthy, my grandparents pulled their family out of poverty and into the middle and upper classes.

Actually, I think one possible factor that feeds dissatisfaction of one's own dance is actually a good thing. That factor is consistency. This is the basis of any useful language. A "tree" is always a tree, and whenever the word is used it evokes the same understanding. And so is a lead always a lead and communication between you and your partner need not be encumbered by uncertainty. Of course, it is the innate creative drive that pushes us to seek new manners of expression. This inspiration, in our best moments, is what makes us poets on the floor.
I couldn't believe the number of people who commented saying they had the same problem. Then I remembered a tv show I'd seen years ago on the same topic.

3. Hey Jude — 20 years ago, this was the vogue song to put at the tops of greatest rock songs ever countdowns that all the classic rock stations would do on holiday weekends. Invariably, Hey Jude and Stairway to Heaven would be sitting right at the top, maybe with Satisfaction hanging around at no. 3. Many Beatles fans might not even put that as their favorite Beatles song anymore, let alone as the best song in rock history. For my money, it’s an amazing song. It just does everything you want a bright, positive pop song to do. And, despite the fact that it’s a piano song, it’s got balls.

The Works Progress Administration, later renamed the Work Projects Administration (WPA), was the largest of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal agencies. It employed millions to carry out various public works projects, such as building and road construction. The first WPA workers were from the Transient Bureau and came to North Carolina’s Outer Banks in 1934. Among other projects, they planted stabilizing grasses to create dunes along the ocean front and aided in the construction of the Waterside Theatre, where The Lost Colony drama is performed each summer. One of the chief projects of the WPA was the construction of dunes for over 100 miles of North Carolina’s barrier islands. Lt. Harold L. Graham was an army Finance Officer stationed at WPA Camp Wirth located on the north end of Roanoke Island, North Carolina. The Lt. Harold L.

We are seeing British kids, seemingly unaware that compared to most places they could have been born, they've actually got it quite cushy. Ok, the jobs situation sucks, and their prospects are not great. There are growing divisions between rich and poor. Public services are being cut. But essentially these kids are alive, safe, fed, housed, living in a democratic country with human rights... and they're taking advantage of safety in numbers to wreck homes, endanger lives, to get their kicks, to get flash tvs and trainers.

After Mummy’s first trimester, her vomiting began. She even became hyper-sensitive of her favorite spicy tuna dish and that is when I realized something was truly wrong. As a kid, I vividly remember being terrified of vomit. That disgusting, smelly, colorful substance was dreadful then and is just as dreadful today. I guess some things never change. Apparently my mother’s nausea was more pronounced because she was experiencing a fairly common side-effect of gestational diabetes, which she had. Living in Papua New Guinea at the time meant that advanced (and more effective) treatments were inaccessible. So, my family decided it was best for Mummy to have Nimisha (my sissy-poo) in India. Consequently, the last month of Mummy’s pregnancy was spent in Lucknow, where our huge and supportive family resides.

I've been on a bit of an odyssey lately. I've been increasingly tired of wearing the same three outfits to church and coming home to stare at fabric that cost a small fortune or going into town for chores and looking like something the cat dragged in with my t-shirts with holes at the belly-button. Ugh. But... it's the same small fortune that also (kind of) keeps me from sewing all my fabric up. I don't want to waste the money I've spent and the fabric that I love so much by making something that I'll never wear.

In terms of communications capability, W-band offers high data rate throughput when used at high altitudes and in space. (The 71 – 76 GHz / 81 – 86 GHz segment of the W-band is allocated by the International Telecommunication Union to satellite services.) Because of increasing spectrum and orbit congestion at lower frequencies, W-band satellite allocations are of increasing interest to commercial satellite operators, although no commercial project has yet been implemented in these bands.

In the above photo with the red apple the negative space is used to emphasize on the structures on the apple surface. See how the more or less strucure-less background brings your attention to the different structures of the apples. And to use a dark background helps here to make the apple the 'brightest' spot in the photo, which makes it easier to highlight even little color differences and textures.
When I bought the book I thought it was a novella. I wasn’t disappointed to find out that it wasn’t because it’s far more than a record of events. It is quite correctly described as a meditation; one where its author comes to the same conclusion that many writers have come to before him, myself included, that words aren’t the answer but they’re all we have left to us. The most profound chapter is actually quoted in full on the book’s cover:
Considering devices like the iPhone (the Freeloader is suggested for use with iPads, Blackberrys and iPods) use very little energy to be charged, I think I will stick to my iPhone charger as the cable and plug are small, light weight, come with the phone and using that bit of kit it only takes just over an hour to charge my phone from the mains supply.
On the inside I punched out my sentiment from Pure Innocence' My Basket of Eggs set stamped in Cherry Cobbler ink and layered this with some Happy Heart paper punched with my scallop oval punch. A strip of coordinating paper finishes off the inside.
One wonders what Wordsworth would have made of it? He, of course, hailed the French Revolution with the famous line:
“That’s not the issue, is it?”

I also joined Swagbucks after seeing it promoted on this personal finance blog, though I’m not sure if it’ll be any help. It’s taken me two weeks to get to 100 points, for instance, and the minimum for a $5 gift card from Amazon is 450 points. Speaking of which, I’m also an Amazon Associate, though it does take a while to collect enough for a gift card. Still, every little bit helps, though there are a few lines I don’t want to cross – like having Google ads on my blog.
A fun fact: I played this by ear. I don’t know how long I baked these for, but these were by far the best calzones that I’ve made.
I guess I can also mention that I was a winner too, I won the “Tweet Your Seat” contest and won a $20 gift certificate to Pete and Shorty’s!
Hi everybody, welcome to my second Holiday design tutorial! In this tutorial I'll be showing you how to make the classic Christmas tree shape, with the help of tape for perfectly crisp lines. The design isn't too difficult to achieve, but you do need to cut and place many tape strips, so you may want to use it for accent nails only if you'd like to save yourself a lot of work ;-) Let's give it a try, shall we?
“Hey, you kids ready to help get the chairs?” said my Uncle Manuel.
My next visit in Coimbatore was at Sewa Nilayam…a Trust dedicated towards working with orphaned girls. I was already so tired by the time I reached here and was in no mood to shoot the project. It was just like a refreshment advertisement I saw on TV…the sun had a straw attached to my head and was happily drinking or should I say draining my energy levels. But then, work is work, and I had no time to waste.

Hello all! Today I'd like to share the card I made for Copic Marker Europe! I have decided to use one of my Gorjuss Girl stamps, uninked yet, and to put the focus on it by not adding anything else. This time I only used one stamp and decided to colour the background and extend it to make it fill the whole space of my card.
“Yes, mate, T-Bone steak and a pint – Fifty cents.”
I enjoyed both these books, the biography more than the novel, though I will still read the next in Stachniak’s planned series about Catherine. If nothing else, it makes a nice break from the machinations of the English court.

So while statistics may favor Billy Bennett, I personally think Coutu is the best kicker Georgia’s had since Kevin Butler.
I think hippies are awesome. I don’t mean the pot-smoking music lovers of the 1960′s. I mean the new-millenium hippies. Think about it… they want to save the earth and stop war and animal abuse and promote family and small business and all that good stuff. Who doesn’t think those are great, worthy causes?
Yet there's that upturned chin
Noticing he hadn’t signed it yet, she asked for his paw print.
Now that I bartend in a restaurant, I just tell my customers that it is against company policy for me to drink on the clock. I thank them profusely for the offer and then blame the no-drinking policy on the bosses. If the customer pushes back, I say something along the lines of "Hey, you don't want me to lose my job, do you?" while flashing them a big, fat smile. That usually does the trick and they stop trying to make me feel guilty for not accepting their drink offer.

ANYWAY, I just love it. Growing up, Mom always made sure that us girls got presents on Valentine’s Day. As a kid, it was exciting! and fun! and chocolate before school! but by the time I turned 13, I realized how special it was. Let’s just say I was a late bloomer, so throughout the “painful years” my mom was my only Valentine. To this day, she goes out of her way to let us know that she loves us. One year, we were informed that we’d gotten a cookie basket. Sure, we had to drive 10 miles to go get it, but it was an adventure that netted us both some heart-shaped cookies that said “I love you” on them. The next year, Mom bought us matching panini presses (or was that Easter?).
While our girls were exploring the castle within Carcassonne, Sue and I sat watching the passing parade.
So the Stats as of today:
It's a clever visual reminder of both the delirious heights Eva and Juan Perón find themselves in by the halfway mark of this movie, as well as the unsteady base they've founded their power on. It's a castle built on quicksand, and - amid the eerie, minor-chord chanting of "Perón! Perón!"/"Eviiiita!" - the spotlight reels drunkenly and the framing is permanently off-kilter. This famous sequence is then gloriously bookended by "And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)", which is a montage of the Perón government hemhorraging funds - into hospitals, into infrastructure, into bread and circuses and their own pockets.
Harare - Troops of bag-snatching, truck-looting baboons are causing chaos at a border post between Zimbabwe and Zambia in daily raids for food, NewsDay reported on Tuesday.
Sid wandered around the garden on his own, and being quite resourceful found a tree that he could roost in safely out of reach of any predators. The tree was by my daughters bedroom window. At sparrows little Sid threw back his head and crowed his not-quite crow loud and long - waking the entire household.
Aren't they gorgeous colours and projects? I think I may have to case all three of these at some point. Often I get stuck for ideas of what to make and the Idea Book and Catalogue never fails to give my mojo a boost!
I haven´t written a blog for way to long. But I have a good excuse. I just moved into my new house. And it is a bit in the country side under the mountains so it took a while to get the internet sorted.
Next we meet Katherine, an employee of the local mega church whose delinquent brother, Caleb, has gone missing. Caleb is played by corey Feldman, who is essentially playing himself. The police are not much interested in helping her find Caleb because he has been a notorious troublemaker, so she hires a sarcastic private detective named rafe to find him. Rafe is played by Dennis Miller. We hit the trifecta here. Miller is also playing himself. It is a real shame all three of the main characters do not have to slide into a new persona, yet are all awful. None of the three must be comfortable in their own skin.
We generally avoid political type issues on My Florida Backyard, but a recent news story caught our eye because it involves the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). My Florida Backyard has always been proud of being an NWF Certified Wildlife Habitat; our whole gardening philosophy has always been based on it. So we were disappointed to learn that NWF has announced a partnership with Scott's MiracleGro, the mega-company that manufactures the most commonly used chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the country.
I debate with my self whether to throw the stone back into the sea; to return the gift, have I already taken enough?
“A 2010 report from NGO Monitor which provides information on organizations claiming to advance human rights revealed that Oslo provides tens of millions of kroner annually to West Bank and Gaza NGOs. Some of these organizations are blatantly anti-Israel and promote anti- Israel boycotts.”
The reason the country is uneasy about the Obama administration's response to this attack is a distinct sense of not just incompetence but incomprehension. From the very beginning, President Obama has relentlessly tried to play down and deny the nature of the terrorist threat we continue to face. Napolitano renames terrorism "man-caused disasters." Obama goes abroad and pledges to cleanse America of its post-9/11 counterterrorist sins. Hence, Guantanamo will close, CIA interrogators will face a special prosecutor, and Khalid Sheik Mohammed will bask in a civilian trial in New York -- a trifecta of political correctness and image management.
I love movies that make you think and are sort of puzzles in themselves. And that fight scene? You know the one I’m talking about if you’ve scene the film. I’m adding that to my list of best moments of cinematography.
So… Now that her referral and meds have been sorted out, I’m feeling much happier. I’m going to alert PALs as to what’s been going on though, the paediatric department has shown no empathy or desire to take ownership for D, she was “discharged” due to lack of resources and left in limbo, it shouldn’t be happening. SN parents need to know that there is someone they can turn to with medical problems, resource issues or not. *gets down off soapbox* Rant over.
Who wants to talk about that?
As I read the various comments that have been made, I wonder what has happened to the leadership of this sport over the years? Because when I look at traditional track powers like Britain, Russia and Cuba, I see the legends of the sport from their countries actively involved to help move the sport forward with Sebastian Coe, Sergei Bubka and Alberto Juantorena all in major roles within the sport.

Based on spending £5.00 per lamp in the house and £15.00 for the outside light the cost would be £55.00 for lamps. Electricity saved per year £68.98. This would give a net saving of £14.00 in year 1 and £69.00 each year after. That’s almost £275.00 saved after 5 years.
My worst one so far is it is important that for the reader to see that Howie, a college freshman, knows what a bandelore is. He has to think it is natural for him to know about bandelores, Packard twin-sixes, and other things from the turn of the century, but so far my beta readers are missing that plot point and laughing at my dialog. So even being able to pinpoint where the problem is doesn't always lead to a solution.
Sorry about the photo not being so great. I was fighting with the weather a bit over the weekend. Being new to the group, I have very few Texas related stamps. I'm going to have to come up with some creative ways to use the few I do have until I can purchase more. Since I've been in Christmas card mode lately, I decided to add another to the pile. Isn't this Texas flag ornament stamp the cutest?! I love it! I challenged myself to use more white space again. I'm kinda digging it. :)

The source doesn’t go into any detail about what revision of AMD CPU hardware it’s going to be using, but it could be the forthcoming Piledriver revision of the weak Bulldozer architecture from the AMD FX-8150 CPU.
After a lot of thinking - do we add on, do we just fix the mudroom and the seepage we're getting in the basement, do we move (the option I LEAST wanted)? We've decided to add on. Several months ago this was a much smaller project in our minds. I can hear all of you who've started that way in renovations laughing your heads off at me right now. Yes, the project has grown, much of it due to building codes, but the gist of it is below. (The lines in the drawings curve because I set the plans down on the grass to take the pictures. I assure you, our architect wasn't drunk when she rendered these.)
And that makes me happy.
We ALL run out of steam--writers, editors, proofreaders, marketers, publicists. The best professionals in any sector of the industry are the ones who fight it out a couple more rounds before throwing up their hands. Since you can't guarantee that anyone else who will be working on your book at any other stage will have the time, energy, and bandwidth to give it their all to the bitter end, you, the author, would do yourself a favor by not being the lazy one.
Well over half of Kenya is not just poor, it is Poverty. It is the people we have come to feel sorry for. The ones we will even give money to on the streets, or pass down our old clothes and shoes to. It is the ones the 50 Cent came to feed. They are people we will always sympathise with but will almost never relate to. Unless…

The bouillon cubes mostly came out of a plan to compensate for the lack of meaty flavor when using turkey or chicken in chili. So I tried a couple bouillon cubes, and when combined with beer it was basically like adding a half carton of beer flavored beef broth. Certainly not a bad thing.
Merckx: In the 1975 Tour he was punched by a spectator and was injured but didn’t abandon; he lost by under 3 minutes. He won his last Grand Tour in 1974 at the age of 29 and his last major classic in the spring of 1976, at the age of 30. He retired two years later on May 17, 1978, at the age of 32.
So there you have it. This was probably one of the best and most memorable Thanksgivings I have had thanks to Dan's wonderful family:)
Pakiam pointed out his fear that “the decision not to prosecute appears to legitimise the actions of the Al-Islam journalists”. He added he believed that the Catholic community will be “satisfied” if the journalists and publisher apologise.
Toad in the Hole is a traditional English dish of sausages cooked in Yorkshire pudding batter, I also add bacon to the mix, for extra porky deliciousness. I like it with loads of onion gravy, mash & something green, last night it was brussels sprouts. We had friends around for dinner, and my toad was a hit, I urge you to give it a go, particularly on a cold winters evening when a good solid dinner is required.
Then he went to this verse in Isaiah:
And I’ve been slowly tweaking my blogs to capture what I want them to capture – from the overall look and tone, to the ability they have to accomplish their objectives, and the greater objective of showing who I am and what I’m doing. For me, it’s not about painting myself as a romance writer. I really like romance – reading and writing it. But I like reading and writing other things too – and even the romance I write has some wider things I want it to accomplish. I’m slowly figuring out how to encapsulate “me” and what I’m doing/trying to do. It’s a challenge – an interesting one, but not an easy one. That’s still a work in progress.
Step 5: Depose your hard earned 8€ at the bank.
"That's fine, so long as the benefit claimed is true," you say. I agree. Fallacious and deceitful advertising is wrong. Deliberate misrepresentation of a product can't really be ascribed any intention other than duping people. But this brings us to a related problem, which was best summarized by Bill Bernbach:
Finally, poetry can often express the depth of your emotion without offering any answers. It can also tap into your readers’ deepest longings. How can you share the power of Good Friday through your poetry?
It was one of the first news/media reports in the world to do so.
Welcome to another fantabulous Monday! I can't believe it's already May -- can you? Mother's Day is quickly approaching, so we're celebrating moms this week at Fantabulous Cricut. Challenge #110 asks us to make a project for mom or a special lady with her favorite color.
Okay, so wish me luck! Tomorrow I face the scale, learn where I need to be headed and hopefully get armored up to kick some squishy butt!
That said, we have a couple of announcements to make...
“Preserve me O God for in you I take refuge.”
We Irish love to own our own homes and at 75%, have one of the highest home-ownership rates in Europe. We’re also a fairly conservative people. Marry the two traits together and we become a building insurer’s dream. And most of us hand over the best part of €1,000 each year to insure our homes and their contents.

It was at that moment that Derrek decided to be very careful about voicing what he did and did not know. His face felt hot, but his dismissed it as blushing out of embarrassment.

So, the Twitterverse (and the comments page for said article) is furiously rebuffing the Globe and Mail this morning (also affectionately known now as ‘Globe and Fail’ and ‘Old and Male’), after their editorial team endorsed Stephen Harper for the 41st Federal Election in Canada. No matter what party you support – hell, even if you are a Con lover – this editorial is an embarrassment to journalism. Why’s that, you ask?

Utopia - Utopia was right across the street from the hotel I was staying at. It was a cute, quaint little restaurant. It was a gorgeous evening and we ate dinner outside. Good selection of food and great service!
After relaxed breakfast and packup session Sunday morning, we rolled out. There is a dirt route you can drive that works south towards Capitol Reef but we needed to top off fuel in Hanksville so we got back on pavement and entered the park in a more traditional way. It was to be another gorgeous day, perfect for hiking. After a quick visit to the park’s visitor center to get some beta on the route we headed down to the trail head. The original idea was to hike Burrow Wash which is a technical route on the eastern side of the park. After a talk with one of the rangers he suggested Cottonwood Wash. Typically Cottonwood has numerous water obstacles requiring swimming and wading but this year it was almost entirely dry, a very unusual thing. This sounded like a good opportunity to explore the canyon without having to get wet.
3 All The Things You Are
Since this is a banana cake, I began by preparing the bananas. While this cake has a lovely banana flavor, you only need one cup. I grabbed for 3 of the very ripe bananas sitting on my countertop.
I would say, second, that we have a real obligation to recognize that, if you’re truly faithful, it’s not just an hour on Sundays or Saturdays or Fridays. It’s in fact something that should suffuse your life, to be a part of who you are. And in that sense, it is inextricably tied in with how you behave.
